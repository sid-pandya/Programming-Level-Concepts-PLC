28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,239
from today so you have one full week

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,600
seven days

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
includes a weekend i should be plenty

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
enough time for you to take it

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,360
um and it will need to be done by may

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,799
12th

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,240
another deadline that you should be

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
aware of is that all of missing

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
assignments so if you've

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,840
like forgot about assignment number one

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,799
or number two

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,560
or something and you're missing it you

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,159
can still turn it in

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,680
you can turn it in all the way up to

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,439
then including may 9th

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,400
which is this coming up sunday so this

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
sunday is may 9th

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
uh it's the last day that you can turn

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,880
in any missing assignments

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,040
i just did a bunch of grading this

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,640
morning so if you've turned something in

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
recently you should have gotten a grade

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,479
for it

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,320
if you're still missing work have it

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,240
turned in by midnight

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
on may 9th that's the last day i'll

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,159
accept it

55
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,920
needs to be graded before the final exam

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
week starts um so your final exam can be

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,600
taken and you don't have to turn in all

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,159
your signs

59
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,840
before you take the final exam you can

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
take the final exam any time you want

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
i would suggest doing it after you

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
complete the assignments however um

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,000
but that's um that's not gonna

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,040
preclude you from taking it um so turn

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
all the assignments in by may 9th

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
have the final exam taken by wednesday

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
may 12th so let's talk about the final

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
exam for a few minutes

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
here i put the link to the respondus

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,520
browser

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
in the final exam section because i've

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
already had some students contacting me

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,000
asking me for the link

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,680
and it's also in the midterm section

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
but if you uninstalled it or something

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
you do need the respondus browser

77
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,239
there's no password or anything but you

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,760
will need the respondus browser no

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,400
camera

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
no cameras required either so there's 22

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,319
multiple choice and true false questions

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,440
worth 35

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,640
points the format is identical to the

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
midterm

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
so the questions are different obviously

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,850
but the format is the same

87
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,040
[Music]

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,760
it's about the same length too you can

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
only take it

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,840
one time so you can't go in and take it

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,879
multiple times

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,200
so it's only gonna one time has to be

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
finished in the same

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,319
seating just like the midterm so once

95
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,280
you start it

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,519
and you'll have to allocate at least an

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,159
hour so that you can finish it

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,480
so start and finish in one sitting you

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,000
have one hour

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
to do 22 questions so it's like

101
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
a little over two minutes a question

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
it's pretty it's pretty good

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,959
that's pretty it's a lot of time read

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,560
the questions carefully

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,239
think about uh your answers

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
take your time select a clear response

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,000
it is closed book closed notes closed

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
internet

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
closed cell phones and so

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,159
if you're not honest with it you're

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,400
really just cheating yourself really

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
um so i suggest being honest

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
uh if you do click on the link here it

114
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
will bring up this

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
page and give you all the instructions i

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
just went over a few minutes ago the

117
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,760
test

118
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,200
is due on may 12th if you decide to

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,439
click on the start here i'm just going

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,040
to test it actually real quick i have to

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,079
move this

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
zoom thing out of the way let's move it

123
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,199
this way a little bit

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,160
there we go well if you click on that

125
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
button it'll ask you for a password

126
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
there's no password you're actually

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
going to do it this way again

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
there we go if you get the screen it's

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
because you're in the wrong browser this

130
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
is the safari browser this is

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,720
not the respondus browser so

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
there's no password it's because you're

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,199
in the wrong browser essentially what

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,960
that means

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,479
all right so let me talk about the exam

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,280
a little bit give you guys a feel for

137
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,880
what is on it also um

138
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,199
answer any questions that you might have

139
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
about the exam

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
so i'm going to stop the share real

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,400
quick so i can bring up

142
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,680
some notes that i have okay

143
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,880
so 22 questions same format

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,000
but it's not cumulative okay so

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,039
the exam does not cover chapters one

146
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,960
we skip two if you remember three and

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,320
four it starts with chapter five

148
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,039
so the exam will start with chapter five

149
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
and it will cover chapters

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,199
five six seven and eight

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
the only accumulative part of the exam

152
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
is that there will be at least two

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
questions on prologue

154
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
two questions on scheme and two

155
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,479
questions on python

156
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,360
you do not have to program there's no

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,039
programming there's no writing any

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,280
source code it's all multiple choice

159
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
but there's also no source code

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
questions where you have to like pick

161
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
source code from option a b and c it's

162
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
on concepts

163
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
if you haven't noticed this is

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
programming language concepts and so

165
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
the concepts are what you're being

166
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
tested on

167
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,919
so chapters five six seven and

168
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,800
eight prologue scheme and python

169
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,919
now the scope for prologue scheme in

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,720
python

171
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
is the scope of the assignments so i

172
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,160
would recommend

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,400
doing all of the assignments before you

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
take the final exam um so that you know

175
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
what did we talk about what did we do

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
about python and what did we do on

177
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,680
scheme

178
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
what did we do on prologue and it'll

179
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
give you the kind of the opportunity

180
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
to refresh your memory if you want to

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,400
review your assignments

182
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
before you can still go into the system

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,840
and see them

184
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
you want to review them before you take

185
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
the final exam that's probably not a bad

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,120
idea

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,319
you just don't have to worry about

188
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,560
anything from before the midterm

189
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
so there's no source code writing all

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,960
assignments are due on may 9th

191
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
now when it comes to the final exam

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,840
um i would not wait

193
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,880
until next wednesday especially

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
um if you think your internet access

195
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
might be a little sketchy

196
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
um i would pick a time in which you're

197
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,080
not gonna be bugged

198
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
here you're not gonna you're not going

199
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,919
to have any interference going on or

200
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,199
i don't know people aren't going to be

201
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,199
bugging you because you only have an

202
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:21,759
hour

203
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,520
and you want to make sure that you can

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
you know calmly

205
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,599
read the questions answer the questions

206
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,479
and

207
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,080
have an adequate time to answer

208
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
and not have to worry about like

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,440
distractions

210
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
um i have had students tell me that you

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
know in the past they were taking it at

212
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,919
work

213
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,000
or they were taking it on the bus or

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
something i'm like thinking that's

215
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
really hard

216
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
so my advice is uh don't

217
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,879
don't take it with a crowd full of

218
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,520
people either try to find a quiet space

219
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
to take it

220
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,160
okay um believe it or not that's

221
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,199
everything you need to know about the

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,000
final exam

223
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
the questions are very theoretical

224
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,840
when it comes to chapters six seven and

225
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,319
eight

226
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,680
i would look at the ppt powerpoint slide

227
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
that's marked six seven and eight that's

228
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,160
in the course materials ah

229
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
let's see if i can find that one

230
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,160
actually

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
i believe i stuck it in the course

232
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
materials ah let's just see this way

233
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,080
real quick here

234
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,879
uh of course of course tool no no of

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
course materials there we go

236
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
and let's go take a look here

237
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
i'm just trying to find which week it's

238
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,159
in there for you

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
it's pretty much of the the main

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,240
concepts that were covered

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,719
up here it is here so this one here it's

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,640
in week 13

243
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
in week 13 there's a power point called

244
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
chapter 6 7 and 8

245
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,560
powerpoint lecture i also go over

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
the videos on chapter 6 7-8 so i would

247
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,480
go over

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
chapter 5 which is names

249
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,720
types bindings

250
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
it's a pretty basic chapter chapter 6 7

251
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,279
and 8 are pretty easy chapters they're

252
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,880
going over features

253
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,839
we have control structures we have data

254
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
types

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
there's a bunch of really cool concepts

256
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,120
in there actually

257
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
i would review in week number 13

258
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,120
i would review the 6 7 and 8 powerpoint

259
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
um i would look at the assignment

260
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
6 preview well actually simon 7 previews

261
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,480
these are some

262
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,279
example questions but chapter 6 seven

263
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,320
and eight

264
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
i did power points on them uh here's

265
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,480
chapter six part one

266
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
chapter six part two and i believe in

267
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
the

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,680
week fourteen we're gonna see chapter

269
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
seven and eight in there

270
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
let's see week 14

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
14

272
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
is going to be the same it's the same

273
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,839
power point by the way it's just

274
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,720
repeated

275
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,519
but here we have chapter seven uh part

276
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,279
one chapter seven part two and then

277
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
chapter eight

278
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,600
watch those videos if you have not done

279
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
so already

280
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,240
that's excellent preparation so i also

281
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
did a video on chapter five i'm probably

282
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,200
going to say it's probably going to be

283
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
in week 12 or so

284
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
about five doesn't really need that much

285
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,320
of a video

286
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
uh but six seven and it will tell you um

287
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
and basically it's design

288
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,920
characteristics or design features

289
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,279
and it's talking about things like

290
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,600
arrays and enumerations

291
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,720
and control structures and data data

292
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,519
structures

293
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
and things of that nature um because the

294
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,000
majority of the exam

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,640
is on chapter six seven at night so

296
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,200
that's

297
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
if you want more bang for your buck i

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,959
would definitely look at these

299
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,479
these particular chapters

300
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,760
questions it seems like i went through

301
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,560
that kind of fast

302
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,000
anybody there

303
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,680
i just wanted to ask uh so the exam is

304
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
gonna be mostly from the powerpoints and

305
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,040
the videos right

306
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,360
correct and it's five six seven and

307
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
eight plus

308
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,480
prologue scheme in python

309
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,760
and it's multiple choice true false

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and my suggestion is read the questions

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,519
thoroughly because you know

312
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,600
some students have a tendency i mean i

313
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,519
think multiple choice is actually harder

314
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
than short answer uh but some students

315
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,360
have a tendency to think you know not

316
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
read the question just like

317
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,440
for example like what are two features

318
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,000
that are

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
not part of a data structure or

320
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
something and then they go not

321
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,079
they they don't read the not in there or

322
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,959
um which ones of these are false which

323
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
ones these are true

324
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
um and so it's kind of it's kind of

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,360
difficult

326
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
if to answer it correctly if you're not

327
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
reading the question and you're not

328
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
knowing oh i want the

329
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,200
negatives or i want the positives of it

330
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,040
yes powerpoint assignments and lectures

331
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
are good yep

332
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
yep so

333
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
yep ah

334
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,399
study chapters

335
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
five six seven eight

336
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
ppt's and assignments

337
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
oops

338
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,839
now the assignments um you had one on

339
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,440
chapter five and you had one on chapter

340
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,000
six

341
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,959
uh those questions are pretty hard and

342
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
they're not multiple choice questions in

343
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,279
there they

344
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,959
are short answer type questions

345
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,480
in the old days i used to do a short

346
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
answer type of final exam

347
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,000
and i'll probably go back to it next

348
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,560
semester but for the because this is

349
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
kind of you know this is an online class

350
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,360
doing it through a web browser i think

351
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,959
multiple choice is just easier for

352
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,160
everybody

353
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
it's like students typing stuff in and

354
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,839
trying to do a chart trying to put

355
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,120
graphics in there it's just too

356
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
difficult

357
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
so much easier if you could just pick

358
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,000
the right answer from multiple choice

359
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,680
do we have any other questions you can

360
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
type it in the chat

361
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
or you can verbalize it

362
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,720
the exam is fairly straightforward

363
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,920
um you know

364
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
i mean the best advice i have for you is

365
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
just read those questions properly don't

366
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,800
rush it

367
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
if we don't have any questions this is

368
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,000
going to be a

369
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,680
super super short meeting

370
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
but i can hang out and answer questions

371
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,440
about

372
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,399
assignments i've got the final

373
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600

and you're welcome

378
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,480

381
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680

436
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000

437
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
group of students by the way

438
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,519
you guys should pat yourself on the back

439
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,079
um i have never had this many students

440
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,079
turn in assignments on time

441
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,800
and actually finish on time last

442
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,519
semester

443
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120

with the program

447
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,000

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
vaccinated and you're all

449
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,120

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,680
