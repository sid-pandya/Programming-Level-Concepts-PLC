midterm

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,600
last week do you guys have any questions

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,040
about the midterm

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,320
i guess we should start out with those

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,840
questions first if there are any

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,040
questions

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,680
so this is only midterm correct excuse

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,320
me

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
this is the only midterm of the semester

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
right and then it's just the final

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,000
afterwards

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
okay we only have one midterm one

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,399
midterm and one final exam

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
all right well if you don't have any

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,239
questions um

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,559
you can also send me an email message

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,720
and i can answer them by email

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,920
um the scores were pretty good i was

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
pretty happy with the results

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,439
it seems like everyone's got a pretty

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,280
good grasp even though we're in the

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,080
kind of a weird online environment

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
everything's looking good

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,799
um so i'm gonna assume that you guys are

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,240
good with the uh

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
you know you're doing well so your

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
scores are reflecting it

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,240
i'm assuming there's not any problems if

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,680
you do have a problem you are

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,439
experiencing some difficulties with the

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,079
class

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,240
reaching out to me by email is a great

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,159
way of getting a hold of me

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,040
or creating a you know getting a zoom

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,240
session

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,320
scheduling a meeting with me would work

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,439
out just fine

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,360
okay so i'm going to take a look at the

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
course schedule

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
i just touch base because it's been a

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,119

class

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,000
since the pandemic i'm so i'm really

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
excited about it but i don't know what's

84
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,480
going on

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
haven't been to campus in a year don't

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
know what to expect when i get there

87
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,879
i have a key for the door but you know

88
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,920
it might be locked

89
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
i have a problem and rather than having

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,000
you guys wait online for

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
for me to connect uh i would just rather

92
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,440
just uh just kind of cancel it and

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,879
test out the waters make sure i have

94
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,159
internet access and make sure

95
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
everything's working and then we will

96
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,959
regain

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,080
we will have another meeting on uh 3

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
24 and i'll do it right from the campus

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,319
so anyway long story short you don't

100
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
even know all those details but long

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,519
short story short we will not have a

102
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
meeting next week

103
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
so that i can make sure everything is

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
working properly

105
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
the classes for cs621 will be in person

106
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,120
for next week

107
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,239
that is correct uh karina

108
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
if you guys i know i do some grad

109
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,840
students in this class if you are in the

110
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
cs620

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,040
class uh and you're also in this class

112
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
uh which is kind of interesting um i

113
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,879
will be holding

114
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,760
this class via zoom in the 621 classroom

115
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
next uh not next week i'll be doing it

116
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,439
the following week

117
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,799
because i have no idea what i'm going to

118
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
run into next week

119
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
um so it'll be weird you can actually

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,959
show up early

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,040
if you are in the 621 uh

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,478
what do we mean that's gonna be

123
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,519
difficult if you're in the 620 cs621

124
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,798
class which is the graduate level

125
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,479
operating systems design class

126
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,199
and you have this class right before the

127
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,400
live

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
session i recommend showing up early

129
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,600
um i will be in the building at 11 00

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,720
am and i will be in that classroom at 11

131
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,000
am you can bring your computer

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,280
sit at a desk we'll have an online

133
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,400
zoom meeting and then we'll have the

134
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,880
live

135
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
6 21 meeting um

136
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
but next week we'll be kind of i'm going

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
to show up early next week and see

138
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,520
but i have a strange feeling i need to

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
all right i don't know about the

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
internet access i have to make sure i

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
have internet access i have to make sure

142
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,880
the logistics work out that building and

143
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
that classroom is not being used etc and

144
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,280
so forth so i'm going to try it out

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,880
experiment next week and see what

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,639
happens um

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,880
so i wish i could also come over

148
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,759
um yeah i think i'm gonna get in trouble

149
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
i don't think unless you're in the 621

150
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,960
the graduate class you can't

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,560
no i can't attend it live i ha

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,440
i will need to get permission for 3-1-1

153
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
students to show up

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
um but

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,880
you cannot show up yet so let's just

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
keep that one on the down low

157
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,639
and uh i know um i am missing college

158
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,759
too i'm missing

159
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
missing the face-to-face meeting so i

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
believe in a fall the 3-1-1 class will

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,319
be face-to-face by the way

162
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,479
and also my 621 class but anyway long

163
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,680
story short

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,160
uh i know i just gave you way too much

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
information

166
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
no class meeting next week for 311

167
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639
because i'll be experimenting

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,319
okay so we are expected to have 50

169
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,240
percent of classes back in person for

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
those who don't know well that's good

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,039
thank you for that update so yeah while

172
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,080
we are discussing

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,560
that it's good to know 50 of the classes

174
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,759
will be back in person

175
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,919
that's good um apparently they need to

176
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,600
make sure we have enough capacity

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
uh because we're only allowed to operate

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,880
at 25 room capacity and

179
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,039
if you are in the 621 class and you are

180
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
showing up

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,039
uh not this semester fall semester fall

182
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:41,919

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
this meeting just to remind everybody

190
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
that next week's meeting will be

193

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
internet access and everything i just

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,319
don't like

198
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,280
just only you know unexpected issues

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
that happen

200
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,479
uh you know like showing up to a

201
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
building that hasn't been opened in a

202
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:26,960
year

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
i don't even know if i'm gonna have

204
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,000
anybody there to open the door

205
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
for the outdoor door for me uh so we'll

206
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,360
see what happens

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
i'm not optimistic but let's see

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
okay so last week was week seven today

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,759
is the 10th i believe it is march 10th

210
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,680
we are in week 8 of the class

211
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
you should be finishing assignment

212
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
number three which is due at the end of

213
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
this week assignment number three is on

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
scheme

215
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
uh the scheme programming language

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
assignment number four

217
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
is on a language called prologue and i'm

218
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
going to talk about prologue today

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
and i'll start the lecture on prologue

220
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,199
and i'll finish it next week

221
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
so the lecture that i'm going to cover i

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,960
just put up this morning

223
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,599
because i noticed it wasn't there it is

224
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
a review the lecture on prolog

225
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
programming called prologue.ppt

226
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,599
it is in the week eight materials right

227
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,240
at the top

228
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,160
right underneath assignment number four

229
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,440
so i'm going to go over assignment

230
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,240
number four

231
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
first and then i will go over prologue

232
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
i will start prologue today and then i

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
will finish it

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,000
not next week but the following week so

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
you have plenty of time the assignment

236
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,200
is not due until march

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
28th uh today is

238
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,240
actually the 10th uh next week is the

239
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
17th and then we have the 24th

240
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,320
it's not due until that week so we'll

241
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
have plenty of time between now and the

242
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,680
24th we are a little bit ahead of

243
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
schedule actually which is good

244
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,600
i had to go over prologue yeah i'm

245
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
thinking you're gonna find it quite easy

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,760
now there are some prologue lectures in

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,519
here these are not bad these are good

248
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,880
prologue part one

249
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,279
part two and part three you'll need to

250
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
know about prologue

251
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
from a fact and rule base but you'll

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,800
also need to know about the list

253
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,120
so the list processing in prologue which

254
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,680
is this list of pairs

255
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,399
so the last video has the list in it but

256
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
these are pretty small i would recommend

257
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:22,959
watching

258
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
all of them and also going over the

259
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
prologue that ppt lecture for example

260
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,640
so okay so let me switch over

261
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,920
to the assignment find the assignment

262
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
let's see here it is

263
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
that's what it is let's stop this one

264
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,640
and

265
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,240
we'll start prolog

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
i highly recommend using the swish

267
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,120
let me show that to you i just clicked

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,200
on the link that was in the assignment

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
i know i just started to share but let

270
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,279
me start a new share now

271
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,640
and it took me to the swiss swish

272
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
it's prologue and so you write the

273
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
syntax in this lower window down here

274
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
where i'm hovering my mouse

275
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
the output will show up over here as

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,160
well there's a ton of cool stuff in here

277
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
uh there's some prologue tutorials

278
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
there's some lists

279
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,399
so you can look at the list processing

280
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,480
over here and this is this is prolog

281
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
code on the left hand side over here

282
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
uh we have a little knowledge base uh

283
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,519
and i'll talk about what these things

284
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
are in a few minutes

285
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
some examples and then the examples

286
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
you'll see

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
puzzles you'll see

288
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
io machine learning graphical output

289
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
some ai

290
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,959
examples and so over here you've got all

291
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,519
of the

292
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
kind of code examples and tutorials and

293
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,000
things

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,519
and then over here is where you write

295
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,120
the stuff in and they have a little run

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
button here

297
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
and i'll run it this is just a fact this

298
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,279
is facts

299
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,480
uh that x a person loves mia

300
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,360
and that x is equal to vincent then

301
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,399
vincent

302
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,920
or x is equal to marcellus you know

303
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,120
uh in the database to see who who

304
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,000
actually look

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
and you don't know anything about

306
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
prologue yet so probably doesn't make

307
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,440
any

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,480
any probably does not make any uh sense

309
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,839
to you right now

310
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
um but the interface

311
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,680
is what i wanted to show you so let's go

312
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,760
back to the assignment

313
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
so you don't have to install anything if

314
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
you want to install something you can

315
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,920
install

316
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
swi prolog which is the same swi

317
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,320
prologue but it's not

318
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
running on the internet it's running on

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
your computer you'll get a screen that

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
looks very similar but you won't get all

321
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,120
of the examples

322
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,160
or the tutorial links as you do with the

323
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
swish online

324
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
so i highly recommend don't install it

325
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,360
on your computer just use swish

326
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
which is the online version of the swi

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
prologue

328
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,160
okay so the assignment goes through a

329
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,880
bunch of stuff

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,920
brief introduction to prologue

331
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,600
programming and prologue facts rules

332
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
i'm going to give you some powerpoint

333
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,880
information on this in a few minutes so

334
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,160
i'm not going to skip through that and

335
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
then your assignments towards the end

336
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,399
you have question number one given these

337
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,160
relations you're going to define some

338
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,200
new relations

339
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
and you're going to provide the facts

340
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
for father mother male and female

341
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,440
predicates and then test the entire

342
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,079
thing using prologue you'll know how to

343
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,399
do this once i go through the lecture

344
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,240
for number two you're gonna write a

345
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,920
relation remove an

346
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,200
element so it's an element

347
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,399
that is true if r is in the list

348
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,399
which results from removing one instance

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,399
of the element from the list

350
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,959
the relation is false if the element

351
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
isn't a member of the list

352
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,399
so you'll be removing an element from a

353
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
list

354
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,800
and this is kind of a function-ish

355
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
relation and then you're going to answer

356
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
the questions

357
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,160
what are all the answers to the

358
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,399
following queries

359
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
and and then you know it says ask

360
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,040
remove a from you know it's what is it

361
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
going to return so what are what are the

362
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,839
answers following queries and these are

363
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,399
basically queries that are run

364
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,920
using this relation that you're going to

365
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
create so you can run them and see what

366
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
the answers are

367
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
or you can guess at the answers and then

368
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,519
you're going to write a relation sub

369
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,000
sequence with list one list two that is

370
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
true if list one contains a subset of

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
the elements that are in ls2

372
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,720
in list two so so list one is in list

373
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,199
two

374
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,040
in the same order and then how many

375
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
different proofs uh for each one of the

376
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,079
queries

377
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,120
depends on um you know is a

378
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
d in the same sequence in here no

379
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
it's b a in here yes um

380
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,199
explain why there are so many or not so

381
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,000
many

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and then write a prologue relation that

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
returns a list containing the union of

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
elements of two given lists you take two

385
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
lists and you put them together

386
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
and then write a relation anything you

387
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,639
want that does anything that you want is

388
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,920
not performed above

389
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
so you have these five questions to

390
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,199
answer and for this particular

391
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,560
assignment you want to answer

392
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,600
all five so i didn't remove any

393
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,360
to make it any easier for you because

394
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,440
these are pretty super duper easy

395
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,959
to begin with in the code you're writing

396
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,519
is extremely small

397
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
so keep that in mind

398
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,959
and let's talk about prologue so i'm

399
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,199
going to open up the

400
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,120
prologue.ppt unless we have any

401
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
questions about the assignment at this

402
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,519
point

403
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,199
until again prologue is really hard to

404
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,320
answer questions

405
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
all right so this is the logical

406
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
programming language

407
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,839
featuring prolog your new favorite

408
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,839
programming language

409
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,040
all right so prologue falls in the

410
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
category of

411
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,880
logic programming okay and you might

412
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,160
have noticed from looking at that

413
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,800
assignment

414
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
that the logic that we're using

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,199
can overlap into what i call functions

416
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,800
like a function it takes one list and

417
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,399
another list and puts it together

418
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,199
or a function that sees if list one is

419
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
part of list two

420
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,760
or returns true or false if an element

421
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
is actually in a list

422
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,800
which is the list processing you're

423
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
doing um

424
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,519
but they're functions but they're also

425
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,720
facts and rules

426
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
they actually instead of using all of

427
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,000
that vocabulary they call them relations

428
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,480
so it's like in the assignment the

429
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,759
wording you might have noticed the

430
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,279
wording looks a little funny

431
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
you see a relation what the what is the

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,560
relation

433
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
it's just another word for all this

434
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,759
other stuff so

435
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,120
we're not we don't call them functions

436
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
there's no such thing as a function

437
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,160
there's really no such thing as a it's a

438
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,560
list

439
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,480
really but there is a list it's logic

440
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120
so prologue stands for programming logic

441
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
as you see in red here

442
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,800
pro and log so it's the most widely used

443
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,440
well okay it's like the only existing

444
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,519
logic programming language today

445
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,160
no there's no other ones out there so

446
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,440
it's the only thing you have

447
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
started in 1970s what is it good for

448
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,199
well oops

449
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,079
it is good for knowledge representation

450
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,680
i'll talk about that if you natural

451
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,000
language processing believe it or not

452
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,880
rubik's cube solving problems state

453
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,440
space

454
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
problems expert systems deductive

455
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,079
reasoning and deductive databases and

456
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,959
agents the main idea is you ask the

457
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,720
computer a question and it solves the

458
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,040
problems using principles of logic

459
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
okay i always say remember the eight

460
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,920
ball

461
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,120
and a magic eight ball that wasn't using

462
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
any programming that was just you know

463
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
whatever floated to the top

464
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,320
but you took the vial and you shook it

465
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
you said is it going to rain today

466
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,959
and the magic 8-ball comes up this is

467
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,360
highly likely

468
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,240
man that's prologue so you put a bunch

469
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,800
of data

470
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,440
into the database system or into the

471
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
prologue knowledge base

472
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
and then you ask prologue a question you

473
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,799
can ask it the same question you could

474
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,799
say is it going to rain today

475
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,959
a prologue can come back and say yes it

476
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,000
is or

477
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,959
no it's not most prologue systems they

478
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,079
don't come back with

479
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,959
you know try again later or highly

480
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,839
unlikely

481
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,919
or highly likely it's just yes or no

482
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,240
uh so you can sort of consider prologue

483
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
sort of like that magic 8-ball if you

484
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
have no idea what the magic 8 ball is

485
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,000
don't worry

486
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
about it you can google it later and buy

487
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,559
your family one for christmas

488
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
and uh you know they should be pretty

489
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,919
cheap at this point

490
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,799
uh because they're like an old old old

491
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,360
little

492
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,280
toy from the past kind of a retro toy

493
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,080
the main idea though is the same so the

494
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,360
program states the known

495
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,080
facts you ask it a question you make a

496
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
statement and ask the computer to search

497
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,760
for a proof that is true

498
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,440
and then the additional mechanisms are

499
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,679
provided to guide the search to find and

500
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
proof

501
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,639
let's compare this

502
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
okay so c c is an imperative programming

503
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,520
language

504
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,960
prologue is a declarative programming

505
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
language

506
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,799
it's like okay imperative languages

507
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,600
are things that have assignment

508
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
expressions

509
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,039
variables iteration the programmer

510
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
designs the way the program is going to

511
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,320
run

512
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
and it runs the same way every time you

513
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
run it well

514
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,919
give or take a few event driven

515
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,400
statements of code that you could put in

516
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,480
but for the most part your c function

517
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,440
runs like your c

518
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,480
function your main function just runs

519
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
the c commands in the same order every

520
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
time you run it

521
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,679
in a declarative programming language

522
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,160
you make

523
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,559
declarations so you don't have a

524
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,000
predetermined flow of execution through

525
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
the program

526
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
instead you ask it questions and it

527
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,120
answers you in a symbolic language form

528
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,760
so prolog is declarative you make

529
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,720
declarations

530
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,640
and i'll show you some examples of these

531
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
in a few minutes but declarations

532
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,720
generally come out in the form of facts

533
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
and rules

534
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
which is part of what the concept of a

535
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
knowledge base is

536
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,080
okay so the logic is non-procedural

537
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,880
it doesn't go from one line at the top

538
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,039
of the code to the bottom of the code

539
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,520
when you write the database you're

540
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,600
populating it with things and the things

541
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
you're populating it with

542
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,919
are relevant facts and rules even the

543
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,400
list

544
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,679
is a fact and the list processing is a

545
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,039
rule

546
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,520
the method of inferences whatever is

547
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,559
desired to produce the results

548
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,559
it's based on this predicate calculus

549
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
kind of concept and i'm going to come

550
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,520
through an example or two in a few

551
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
minutes that will show you

552
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,200
what this actually means and here's sort

553
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
of the way that you write the statements

554
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,600
you

555
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,080
they're called horn clauses and i guess

556
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,480
you'd have to go back to discrete math

557
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,520
uh yeah i think this is just great math

558
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,440
uh where you get like boolean

559
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
boolean algebra stuff and you get horn

560
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,000
clauses like so if

561
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,600
a one and a two and a three then h

562
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,360
so h is the head the body is a1 and u2

563
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,080
so if x is this is how the logic goes so

564
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,640
if x is positive and y is negative

565
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,919
then y is less than x

566
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,120
i think that's discrete math and prolog

567
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
is written like

568
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,000
this and we sort of saw that because it

569
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
was a sample that was

570
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,640
running on the swish interface

571
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
where we make this and this thing is

572
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
called a proposition a proposition

573
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,880
is a logical statement that uses a

574
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
relationship

575
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,799
but there's no value to the actual words

576
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,480
so man john likes pizza and

577
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,919
baseball they're called funktors

578
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,840
it's kind of like a function but they're

579
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,960
not really a function

580
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,120
and then what's in the brackets are

581
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
parameters

582
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,200
but mostly these are i call them just

583
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
you could just call them facts

584
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,840
the fact of the matter is that john is a

585
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,480
man

586
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,600
and pete's and john likes or people can

587
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,120
like pizza and baseball

588
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,320
and then we put these facts together and

589
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,799
they might consist of two or more

590
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,360
of the logical connectors for example we

591
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
have like the negative

592
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,760
not a or a and b a or b

593
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
this is definitely discrete math a is

594
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,120
equivalent to b

595
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,159
a implies b b implies a implication

596
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,880
equation

597
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,200
conjunction negative all of the

598
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,880
different possibilities that

599
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
are part of the foundation of predicate

600
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
calculus you don't really have to do

601
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
too much math to figure out the kind of

602
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,640
formulas to use because you're only

603
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
using all of them all over again it's

604
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,320
like maybe half a dozen like six ways of

605
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,080
expressing it

606
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,720
variables appear in the formula but only

607
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,799
when introduced by qualifiers

608
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,000
so for example for all women are

609
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,159
human there is no sport that bill likes

610
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
and this is not prologue code over here

611
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,000
uh this is just an illustration of the

612
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
concept of the qualifiers

613
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
i'm going to show you some code in a few

614
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,039
minutes there's a resolution and then

615
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
there's unification

616
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,400
there's forward and there's backward

617
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,840
reasoning so what we're talking about

618
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,159
now is the reasoning system

619
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,159
so you type in a bunch of facts you type

620
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,760
in a bunch of rules

621
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,080
and then you pick a reasoning system and

622
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,120
the reasoning system

623
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,480
by default is selected by the

624
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
interpreter so your runtime interpreter

625
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,320
let's say in

626
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,159
python is reading each line of code

627
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,600
and it is executing

628
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
whatever it is the user wants you to do

629
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,919
you say you write code in python very

630
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,080
similar to write code in c

631
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,120
line by line and it's running in

632
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,960
sort of a pseudo-imperative kind of

633
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
fashion

634
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,840
in prolog you put a fact in it's like

635
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
okay here's a fact

636
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
put another factor here's another factor

637
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,360
there's another factor there's another

638
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,480
fact

639
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
and the interpreter is keeping track of

640
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
where where are the facts

641
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,559
where the lists where are the rules you

642
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,159
know and there's all these categories of

643
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,600
things that you're putting into the

644
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
system and you're populating it

645
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,080
which is called the knowledge base and

646
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,400
then the runtime's job

647
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
is to provide the resolution and

648
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,720
unification

649
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,320
so resolution is how do we deduce from

650
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,919
multiple horn clauses

651
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,080
the answer how do we solve the problem

652
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
so the

653
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,640
compiler aka interpreter

654
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,919
is solving the problem for us

655
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
so we give it a problem and it solves

656
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
the problem so if the head of the horn

657
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,960
clause

658
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,640
let's say number one matches one of the

659
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
terms and then whole class number two

660
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,080
then when we replace them in the body

661
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,440
and the clause number one

662
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,039
and yeah yeah you don't really need to

663
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,640
do that the interpreter is doing it for

664
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,000
us and how do you determine when the

665
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,960
hypothesis

666
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,919
are satisfied is when you get a match

667
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,080
when there's some sort of substitution

668
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,679
that makes sense

669
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,960
so if you can substitute in data facts

670
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,480
into rules follow the rule

671
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,600
to find another substitution and you're

672
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
asking if that substitution exists

673
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,159
and if it's found the prologue system

674
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,960
can come back and say yes

675
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,559
if not then it says no let me give you a

676
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,000
little example and then there's an

677
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
example on the screen

678
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,440
but let me give you one actually let me

679
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,559
go through the one on the screen i'll

680
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:48,960
give you

681
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,720
another one that makes more sense the

682
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
resolution this is we're talking about

683
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,559
the resolution to resolve

684
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,760
the problem it's an inference rule

685
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,840
that allows us to infer propositions to

686
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,360
be computed by a given process of

687
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
position so suppose we have two

688
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,559
propositions

689
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,679
b implies a and d implies

690
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,200
c and then a is identical to d

691
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
and suppose they're going to be name a d

692
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,520
is t

693
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,919
then here we can infer that b implies c

694
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,960
all right let me give you something in

695
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,600
plain english

696
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,520
all tall people so just this is not true

697
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,720
i'm just making some crap

698
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,080
up here all tall people like

699
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
pizza bill

700
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,799
is a tall person does bill like pizza

701
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,600
yes yes phil likes pizza because all

702
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,720
tall people

703
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,960
like pizza mary is short does mary like

704
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,840
pizza

705
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,440
no okay

706
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,200
all people who like pizza

707
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,799
also like baseball

708
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,679
john likes pizza does john like baseball

709
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,120
prologue can say yes all right simple i

710
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,320
know very simple

711
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,039
very simplified okay imagine more

712
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,720
complex

713
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,159
logic with multiple different

714
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,799
levels or layers for example

715
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,679
it rains outside when there is a high

716
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,400
level

717
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
of precipitation as

718
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
is a fact high level precipitation rain

719
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,159
low level precipitation no rain

720
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,799
clouds in the sky rain no clouds in the

721
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,600
sky

722
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,200
no rain um temperature

723
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,559
above 70. no rain

724
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,720
temperature below 50 possible rain

725
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,760
could rain um

726
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,200
the months of the year you know january

727
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,799
february march april may

728
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,840
with their associated rain values

729
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,799
likelihood of rain yes or no and then

730
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,159
you ask the question

731
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,000
on march 17th is it going to rain

732
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,279
and then prologue would come back and

733
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,080
say yes actually training right now in

734
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,559
campbell

735
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,399
so i can say yes but why did it say yes

736
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,000
well because he goes back and says well

737
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,080
in march there's a highly likelihood of

738
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,200
rain

739
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,480
if there's cloud and there's clouds in

740
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,399
the sky okay there's rain so it's

741
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,039
it might you know need more information

742
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,720
it might come back and say

743
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
uh no and says well there's clouds in

744
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,919
the sky

745
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,600
and it's march and the precipitation is

746
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,320
high

747
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,279
and the temperature is low then prologue

748
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,960
can come back and say yes

749
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,840
so it's just the way humans think and

750
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,880
it's used a lot

751
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,039
in artificial intelligence and for

752
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,559
natural language processing believe it

753
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,440
or not to come out

754
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
and to formulate a response to a

755
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,799
question

756
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,120
from a bot or from some sort of a

757
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,760
logical inference that might be made

758
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,679
so unification is the process of finding

759
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,679
values for variables

760
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,600
during the resolutions so that the

761
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,520
matching process can succeed that's what

762
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,399
i just did it was unification by saying

763
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,840
it's march today is on march 17th but

764
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,960
today is march 10th

765
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,000
i have to say i'm stuck on the 17th you

766
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,559
know

767
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,240
i can look it up and i can use

768
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,760
unification

769
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,840
to find a correlating fact

770
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,679
to contribute to my resolution process

771
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,919
and instantiations temporary binding of

772
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:34,799
a value

773
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,960
and type to a variable to allow the

774
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,640
unification to happen the variables

775
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,440
instantiate

776
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,919
only during the resolution process

777
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,120
anyway there's a lot of

778
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,600
stuff you don't really have to know but

779
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,080
it kind of explains

780
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,039
how the prologue engine kind of works

781
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
all right so i'm going to kind of skip

782
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,000
ahead you can read this on your own a

783
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,279
little bit here i'm just going to kind

784
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,000
of skip ahead past the terminology and

785
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,799
go right into the syntax

786
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,000
okay we have a goal we have a query

787
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
we usually have a question mark at the

788
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,159
front it tells the prolog interpreter

789
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,880
see if it can solve and prove a problem

790
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,120
okay we have facts

791
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,799
rules and queries so in the first one

792
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,559
you have a family tree and i'll tell you

793
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
that the first

794
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,039
question on the homework assignment is

795
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,760
actually answered in this lecture

796
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,279
it's answered in the lecture further

797
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,039
down the road here

798
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,559
and i'm going to get to it momentarily

799
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,559
and i'll show you the answer before

800
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,159
this meeting is over just in case you

801
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,919
want to work on that assignment

802
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,760
next week and we don't we haven't

803
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,640
finished the lecture yet

804
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
so we have a collection of effects and

805
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
rules that's called the knowledge base

806
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,440
so it's kind of like um

807
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
it's kind of like human learning and if

808
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,360
you look at it from an ai perspective or

809
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,919
a machine

810
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,799
learning perspective it represents the

811
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,360
brain

812
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,120
the human brain so for example um

813
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,320
we go through life memorizing things

814
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,159
and then we go through life learning

815
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,440
rules

816
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
and we constantly ask ourselves

817
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,960
questions to navigate through life

818
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,840
you know for example uh everybody's

819
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,960
learned the rule of what hot and cold is

820
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,080
and everybody has learned the rules of

821
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,559
which items are associated with hot and

822
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,600
cold

823
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,000
so as a baby everybody burned themselves

824
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,520
at least one time

825
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
and you froze yourself at least one time

826
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
so you could feel

827
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,919
what he felt like actually a

828
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,679
psychologist say this is true

829
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,600
everybody has burned themselves one time

830
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,960
how do you how do you know what hot is

831
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
if you haven't burned yourself

832
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,159
either you touched the stove you touched

833
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,159
a candle you touched something

834
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,159
to feel the heat okay

835
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,919
now what you can do is new things come

836
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,200
in that you haven't seen

837
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,399
before you can relate them and put them

838
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,080
into categories

839
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,320
and this is learning theory so let's say

840
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,919
you were a baby and you burn yourself on

841
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,360
a stove

842
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
and then there's this big old pot of hot

843
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,640
water

844
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,279
and you see a similar you see similar

845
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,960
traits like you see steam

846
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,279
coming up from the water like you saw

847
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
steam on the stove

848
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,159
you see redness you feel the sensation

849
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,000
of heat

850
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,840
your brain should tell you don't touch

851
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,440
the water it's hot

852
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
or better yet you see a candle and you

853
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,919
see a flame or a fire

854
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,600
your brain is supposed to tell you

855
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,200
through its queries that

856
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
that fire is hot and you're not supposed

857
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,720
to touch it

858
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,039
and if that is true that's your

859
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,480
knowledge base

860
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,360
and your knowledge base is able to

861
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,919
answer

862
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,399
queries for you automatically as you go

863
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,200
through human reasoning and human logic

864
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,480
so a smart person doesn't touch

865
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,799
things that are hot because they're

866
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,080
going to burn themselves

867
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,159
so you don't go around constantly

868
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,840
touching things and

869
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
yeah you got the baby here too this just

870
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,799
never learns it's kind of like the

871
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,159
people in prison

872
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,919
when you say you're not supposed to

873
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,200
steal

874
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,799
you're not supposed to kill people

875
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,320
you're not supposed these are all the

876
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,000
rules that you're supposed to learn but

877
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,919
you keep breaking the rules

878
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,840
because you have some other form of

879
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
justification

880
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,320
for breaking the rule that it doesn't

881
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,840
make any sense to the

882
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,159
reasonable accepted rules and so you end

883
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,200
up in prison

884
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,360
or you end up burning yourself or

885
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,320
getting yourself into danger because

886
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,960
you're not following the rules correctly

887
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,039
so the rules in the knowledge base

888
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,039
for a human are to make you a functional

889
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,399
adult in

890
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,760
prologue it's to add richness or value

891
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,279
to the knowledge base so that we don't

892
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,000
have to be

893
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,640
experts on a particular subject area we

894
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,120
just go to the knowledge base

895
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,600
to acquire the knowledge so that's the

896
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,000
art of this style of programming

897
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,880
called logic programming programs are

898
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,279
called law uh knowledge bases

899
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,960
so you use prologue by posing queries

900
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
like should i rob the bank should i

901
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,840
touch the hot stove

902
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,279
should i and these are the kind of like

903
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,000
life queries that you might think about

904
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,360
okay so using a knowledge base we have

905
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,919
some facts we have woman janet woman

906
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,720
stacy

907
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,399
plays flute stacy we ask for a lot of

908
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,640
women stacy your prologue answers back

909
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,799
yes because there's a fact in the

910
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,399
database that says woman

911
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,600
stacy place do

912
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,720
this place the place flute stacy then

913
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,519
prolog comes back yes plays sploot mary

914
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,360
and it comes back are you kidding me and

915
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,720
now it does and it comes back and says

916
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,840
no

917
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,360
unless you program it to come back and

918
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,320
say are you kidding me

919
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,919
so i say it's kind of like the eight

920
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,080
ball shaking that april around and it

921
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,679
comes up with these various answers but

922
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,320
unlike the eight ball prologue is a

923
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
little bit more reliable

924
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,080
so you could ask roblox some questions

925
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,519
and this is a predict it's called

926
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,799
predictive systems

927
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,440
you can ask prologue some questions and

928
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,360
then roll i could come back and say

929
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,200
you know maybe highly likely

930
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,399
because it comes out the correlation

931
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,800
you're like well what kind of examples

932
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
of this type of programming do we have

933
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,079
in the real system

934
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,280
in in a real world

935
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,960
and then you look at this and you go

936
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,040
well what about those prediction systems

937
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,839
users who liked this movie this movie

938
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,079
and this movie

939
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,800
are gonna like this one over here so if

940
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,079
you've ever been in or

941
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,839
looked at netflix um most people i know

942
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,280
in the pandemic have

943
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,760
totally ventured out into streaming uh

944
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,719
netflix

945
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,119
is a good example of a recommendation

946
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,239
system

947
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,760
um we watch a movie and it tells you

948
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,918
uh you have a because you watch this

949
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:52,879
movie

950
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,760
you're gonna like these other movies

951
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,520
that's prologue that's logic and how's

952
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,960
it doing it's keeping track of

953
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
everybody who's watched the movie how

954
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,000
long they watch the movie and there's

955
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,320
some other analytics in there too

956
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,599
this would all be kept you can do a

957
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,160
prologue database to do a recommendation

958
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,520
system and there's a ton of them out

959
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
there actually

960
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,400
sample recommendation systems that say

961
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
you know because you watched

962
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,680
um i know now this movie

963
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,480
x y and z you're also going to like this

964
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
other movie

965
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,440
and then actually believe it or not uh

966
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,920
netflix uses a little bit of statistical

967
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,440
analysis in there because it says

968
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,880
there's a 98

969
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,079
match i always look at that and go a 98

970
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,680
match you're gonna like this movie and

971
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,440
i'm thinking well why

972
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,280
it's because i watched that other movie

973
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,200
but maybe you watched only like two

974
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,720
seconds of the other movie well

975
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,760
netflix is smart enough to know if

976
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,359
you've watched the movie from

977
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,079
start to end or did you watch just the

978
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,160
first five or ten minutes or get halfway

979
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,040
through the movie

980
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
it also keeps track of how far you've

981
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
gone through series

982
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
suddenly people binge watch on tv series

983
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,760
and movies all the time you go and you

984
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,520
just one episode after another one after

985
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,760
another one you spent all day doing that

986
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,240
well netflix knows you're doing that and

987
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,359
it keeps track of

988
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,040
the speed and the frequency in which

989
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,560
you've been watched it

990
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,680
binge watched it how far you got through

991
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,960
it

992
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,119
and then that's what comes up with this

993
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,920
category called binge worthy

994
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
these are the ones that people have been

995
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,440
binged watched for the longest duration

996
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,880
of time and have made it

997
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,160
past the 50 point or so in the series

998
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,280
so it knows which ones to put into which

999
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
one of the categories and it's using the

1000
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,000
user's

1001
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,119
behavior to predict that

1002
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,560
so it's kind of interesting if you have

1003
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,119
more than one user in your household

1004
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,440
who is clicking on stuff and using stuff

1005
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,800
that's going to cause a problem if you

1006
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,720
create multiple accounts as you probably

1007
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
know you can

1008
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,079
then your stats and your prediction

1009
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,599
system your prologue

1010
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
logic base is going to be kept

1011
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
separate for each one of the users so

1012
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,680
it's a little bit more reliable in terms

1013
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,839
of predictability

1014
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,320
music through spotify through some of

1015
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
the other applications are done this way

1016
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
as well

1017
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,480
where it keeps track of what what types

1018
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,839
of songs you listen to

1019
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,400
what's the beats what's the style and

1020
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,760
then it will recommend

1021
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,000
other songs that fit into that same and

1022
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,760
it's not necessarily a label

1023
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,880
genre it's a characteristic that's being

1024
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,280
kept

1025
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,079
about the particular track of music

1026
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,000
you're listening to

1027
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,880
google keeps track of this information

1028
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,520
as well

1029
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,000
these are used knowledge bases and

1030
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
inference engines

1031
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,480
and logical programming is used all over

1032
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,599
the internet

1033
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,040
and people come into this class think oh

1034
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,280
i've never heard a

1035
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,119
well prologue highly likely that you

1036
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,040
have it it's probably one of the

1037
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,119
it's the first and only logic

1038
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,119
programming system out there

1039
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,880
and it's being used in industry believe

1040
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,359
it or not um whether you'll use it

1041
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,200
if you get into artificial intelligence

1042
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
or machine learning

1043
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,880
or knowledge based programming expert

1044
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,480
system programming

1045
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,599
then you might get into it for example

1046
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,720
triage medical triage systems

1047
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,880
are generally programmed with logic

1048
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,480
programming for example

1049
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,599
a person comes into the hospital and

1050
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,040
there's a bunch of questions on the

1051
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
computer screen that the

1052
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,680
uh check-in nurse needs to record you

1053
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
know do they have a favor

1054
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,040
do they have are they running you know

1055
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
uh are they standing or were they

1056
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,760
brought in a wheelchair or whatever did

1057
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,839
they walk in are they bleeding

1058
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,599
i don't know you know i'm not a medical

1059
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,040
person but all of the

1060
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
you know the things that would be

1061
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,839
recorded and usually it's those

1062
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,079
questions that you're being asked when

1063
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,400
you walk into the emergency room

1064
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,640
uh and then there are persons putting in

1065
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,280
then what community so students

1066
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,200
putting in computer science and says

1067
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,560
okay put a red

1068
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,480
band on them put a orange put a

1069
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,640
yellow wristband on them or put a green

1070
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,599
one on it

1071
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,520
and the color is determining how

1072
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,119
critical your case is

1073
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,160
and so the different colors you'll get

1074
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
care a little faster they're not going

1075
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,000
to make somebody with a brain aneurysm

1076
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,320
wait the same amount of time as somebody

1077
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,160
who just walks in with a common cold

1078
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
so yeah and it's a it's a resolution

1079
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,560
system to see

1080
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,800
what's really raining now just to see

1081
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,240
what's uh

1082
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,480
what category you fall into so the facts

1083
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,720
here are propositions that are assumed

1084
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,000
to be true such as

1085
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,720
female janet male steve brother steve

1086
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,079
janet

1087
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,040
so they have no intrinsic semantics

1088
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,640
which means the words don't mean

1089
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,359
anything

1090
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,359
the word male the word female the word

1091
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,960
brother actually

1092
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,839
doesn't mean what it means in english

1093
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,760
and so some people like to write them

1094
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,160
with

1095
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,359
like f and b or

1096
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,200
just make up words or use a foreign

1097
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
language for it if you want

1098
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,520
it doesn't mean anything just so it

1099
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,400
doesn't have any

1100
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,319
english meaning so

1101
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,880
the rules combine the facts together to

1102
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,839
increase the knowledge

1103
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,760
system for example and this is read

1104
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,400
backwards actually

1105
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,079
male child of x y

1106
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,520
is the sum of x y

1107
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,200
so x is the sum of y if x is male

1108
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,560
and x is also a child of y

1109
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,319
it's a child of x y and

1110
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,359
it's a male child of x y then they're

1111
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,960
going to be a sign

1112
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,599
so sine of x y and this is this believe

1113
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,960
it or not it's supposed to be an

1114
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,720
arrow and the arrow is pointing this way

1115
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,240
so this is the tip of the arrow and

1116
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,200
these are the two sides of the arrow

1117
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,800
so but you know what computer programs i

1118
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,240
don't have the keyboard doesn't have an

1119
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
arrow has a colon an

1120
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,640
minus sign which is the arrow

1121
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,920
and it's red backwards so male x and

1122
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,880
child of x y if it's a child and he's

1123
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,240
male then he must be a sign

1124
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
that's a rule this is a rule and you're

1125
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,160
combining facts together so you have a

1126
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,599
fact about male x

1127
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,640
you have a fact about child x y oops

1128
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,079
didn't mean to do that

1129
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,400
and you are combining it together

1130
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,680
to come up with a rule and you're going

1131
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
to call it sun if this case

1132
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,000
exists then it's going to be assigned

1133
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,359
and then you substitute

1134
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,359
so you put the rule in there and you

1135
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,640
substitute the facts

1136
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,520
into the rules and then you can come out

1137
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,079
with a pretty sophisticated database

1138
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
so here's a rule the rule statement

1139
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,319
takes on the form of the consequence

1140
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,240
equals the antidote so the consequence

1141
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,760
must be a single term

1142
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,319
which is the rule while the antidote can

1143
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,440
be multiple for example

1144
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,520
parent xy is equal to a mother

1145
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,760
ex-wife or leads to a mother so a mother

1146
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,880
ex-wife is a parent

1147
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,160
a father xy is also a parent of x y

1148
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,040
grandparents are parents of parents

1149
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,839
so a parent can be a grandparent

1150
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,319
and parent a male and a parent female

1151
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,839
can be grandma grandpa

1152
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,160
parent

1153
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,800
and so the goal whoops

1154
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,640
and you know i'm going to flip ahead for

1155
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,079
a second because i remember i wanted to

1156
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,760
show you something

1157
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,440
i'm going to come back but i want to

1158
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
show you something here

1159
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,640
so in the first question

1160
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,040
of the assignment let me go back to the

1161
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,319
first question of the assignment

1162
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,919
you find the assignment

1163
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,839
there it is

1164
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,400
we have a father a mother a female a

1165
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
male

1166
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,760
we have these are the rules given these

1167
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,200
are given for you already

1168
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,119
and the syntax has a dot at the end of

1169
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,480
it you don't have to put a dot

1170
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,200
at the end what you're going to do is

1171
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,760
define

1172
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,880
sibling sister grandson or descendant so

1173
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,800
you're going to write one two three four

1174
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,680
more rules

1175
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,040
that provide for the these are facts

1176
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,560
here

1177
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,079
fact that x is male a female is

1178
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,000
x mother is x y x is the mother of y

1179
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,040
and x is the father of y

1180
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,800
and you're going to put together what a

1181
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,240
sibling is

1182
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,599
what a sister is a sister is a

1183
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,280
female sibling so

1184
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,400
a sister and a sibling work together and

1185
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,200
these rules can work together and you

1186
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,000
can make up more

1187
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,960
facts if you need to so you can go you

1188
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,240
know a sister

1189
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,640
is a female also female x

1190
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
of a mother and a father

1191
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,079
which is actually or grandson

1192
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,400
which is the parent level so you can

1193
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,359
actually make a hierarchy if you want

1194
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,520
in terms of a structure but let me show

1195
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,359
you from the powerpoint slide what this

1196
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,960
is talking about

1197
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
and this is a slide 30 of the powerpoint

1198
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,560
it's giving you grandparent okay so

1199
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,280
you have to tell you that it is actually

1200
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,319
so

1201
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,440
consider this database we have a mother

1202
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,319
betty janet

1203
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,920
we have a mother betty steve we have a

1204
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,839
mother janet adam

1205
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,680
father steve dylan we have a parent

1206
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,839
that is defined by a mother we have a

1207
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,359
parent that defined by a father we have

1208
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,240
a grandparent

1209
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,280
that has a mother and a father in it

1210
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,920
parent xy and parent y z it's a

1211
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,040
grandparent

1212
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,079
and the goal is here to find the

1213
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,040
grandparent

1214
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,839
of x adam well then the system

1215
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,200
is going to run through a bunch of

1216
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,839
iteration here prolog proceeds by

1217
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,920
attempting to match the goal clause

1218
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,960
with a fact in the database so it

1219
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,079
matches the goal with

1220
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,280
grandparent xz where z is instantiation

1221
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,720
of atom

1222
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,319
and what i want you to do is kind of

1223
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,119
take this it starts on slide 30

1224
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,760
and uh at your own pace take and come

1225
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,880
through and see if you can

1226
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,319
follow the logic there's a mother in

1227
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:16,720
here

1228
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,560
there's believe it or not you can

1229
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,000
actually easily define

1230
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,720
sister in here as well as brother in

1231
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,079
here

1232
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,920
but what i wanted to show you is this

1233
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,680
tree that comes out of it this is the

1234
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,119
grandparent x

1235
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,839
atom and so this is why i said you can

1236
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:32,720
actually take

1237
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,920
and on a like a scratch piece of paper

1238
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,160
and uh create a tree from this

1239
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,760
to map out the logic and the logic in

1240
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,880
this tree

1241
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,200
is going to run through the the

1242
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,240
implications

1243
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,680
of the different lab levels um

1244
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,359
i need to put you on hold for a second

1245
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,200
because i just noticed there's somebody

1246
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
knocking on my front door

1247
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,560
uh i'm just gonna leave this right here

1248
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,440
for a second

1249
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:15,839
i will be back in one minute here

1250
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,920
you

1251
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
all right sorry for the interruption i

1252
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
am back hopefully you guys are still

1253
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,359
there i wasn't going too long

1254
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,640
this would definitely not happen in a

1255
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,119
face-to-face classroom

1256
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,119
and i can't wait to get back into a more

1257
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,119
professional environment for this

1258
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,000
uh but anyway uh it was my amazon

1259
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,880
delivery of why

1260
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,359
wrong address basically so i wasn't even

1261
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,200
taking care of my stuff it was for

1262
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,119
somebody else

1263
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,520
uh so let's see what do we have here old

1264
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,680
memories

1265
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,520
anyway let's just check in the chat i

1266
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,960
saw something in the chat anyway so

1267
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,559
solving for grandparent x adam

1268
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,960
we could map it out and we could

1269
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,480
substitute the rules in

1270
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,640
and what i want you to do is on your own

1271
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,640
time you know when you have more time

1272
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,319
you're sitting there take a look at

1273
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,760
slides number 30

1274
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,200
through slide number uh

1275
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,000
35 there's about five slides and see if

1276
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,760
you can figure out the logic that is

1277
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,920
associated with the substitution and how

1278
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
the rules work this will help you with

1279
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,800
assignment number

1280
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,520
uh with the question number one that

1281
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,359
asks you to define sibling and then

1282
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,559
what you're doing is you're instead of

1283
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,040
mother you're defining a sibling

1284
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,839
so this will help you sort of and it

1285
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,319
really does take a slower

1286
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,119
look to see how the substitution works

1287
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,400
and how

1288
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,720
sub goals are created and how the goal

1289
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,680
is satisfied

1290
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,200
by substitution of the sub goals

1291
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,520
so now i want to go back to up here and

1292
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,440
talk about the forward chaining and

1293
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
backward chaining

1294
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,000
that is associated and i think i will

1295
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,119
stop and do

1296
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,760
the lists uh next time but we'll see how

1297
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,720
far we get

1298
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,440
so we have the knowledge base we have

1299
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,400
and we went through this example already

1300
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,119
we went through the rule okay so it kind

1301
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,280
of uh the rule itself and this is the

1302
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,800
grandparent rule

1303
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,280
so we this is actually what this is

1304
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,240
actually the question

1305
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,839
this is one of the questions you have to

1306
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,680
do a grandparent

1307
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,200
so we're talking about the goal the

1308
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,520
goals of proposition that we want to

1309
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,440
satisfy to either prove or distribute

1310
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,200
there's two ways of doing it

1311
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,400
you can do forward chaining or backward

1312
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,520
chaining

1313
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,480
prolog by default does a forward

1314
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,400
chaining mechanism and this is something

1315
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,599
you do not have to

1316
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,680
program into the system this is

1317
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,119
something the system does

1318
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,440
for you so this is what the compiler is

1319
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,000
doing for

1320
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,520
you it's creating the chaining mechanism

1321
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,440
to apply the facts to the rules to

1322
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,440
deduce the answers that are going to

1323
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,960
come out of this

1324
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,640
given the particular information that

1325
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,720
you provided so the elements here you

1326
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
should ask prolog the virtual machine

1327
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,200
questions closed at the prompt so son

1328
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,760
bob harry if it's in the database it's

1329
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,800
going to come back and say

1330
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,800
yes king bob france no

1331
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,359
so it just comes back with yes or no and

1332
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,440
you combine answers to questions

1333
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,079
to variables for example who is bob the

1334
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:04,640
son of

1335
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,680
x is equal to harry and then your son

1336
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,079
bob

1337
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,319
x who is male x is equal above

1338
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,000
and so is bob the son of somebody

1339
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,160
you put a underscore in there to leave

1340
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,079
it it's kind of a blank but it's not a

1341
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:20,800
blank it's an

1342
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,160
underscore to say that it's a

1343
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,920
substitution

1344
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,119
so no variables are really bound and

1345
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,000
it's not really

1346
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,400
using the variables it's substituting

1347
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,920
values in

1348
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,720
to perform the propositions and the

1349
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,680
logic

1350
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,640
for the particular cases all right let's

1351
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,000
talk about backtracking

1352
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,040
and forward tracking so how are

1353
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,720
questions resolved here

1354
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,440
we have son x harry so we can start with

1355
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:47,920
a rule

1356
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,680
so we could like say you know for

1357
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,240
example to go backtracking you start

1358
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,200
with a rule

1359
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,879
and then you apply the facts to it

1360
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,559
versus forward chaining which is bottom

1361
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:00,880
up

1362
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,040
starts with each rule and checks for the

1363
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,960
facts

1364
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,640
so that's like the same let me give you

1365
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,240
a backward versus

1366
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,240
the forward and back back tracking

1367
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,119
uses what's called a forward chaining

1368
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,920
technique and it does it from the bottom

1369
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,520
up instead of the top down

1370
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,200
so backtracking versus forward

1371
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,920
tracking or two different directions so

1372
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,839
let me give you an example backtracking

1373
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,680
let's start with backtracking i'm

1374
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,559
talking about that tracking right now

1375
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,359
i come up with a conclusion and i say it

1376
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,040
is going to rain today

1377
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,400
and i tell uh prologue it's going to

1378
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,800
rain

1379
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,720
i make a determination that it is going

1380
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,240
to rain today

1381
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,240
so what it does is come back and say yes

1382
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,000
or no

1383
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,480
so i'm starting with the conclusion

1384
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,280
instead of asking prologue

1385
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,400
is it going to rain today

1386
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,839
so you're starting at two different

1387
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,119
directions i'm starting with a

1388
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,000
conclusion when i'm doing backtracking

1389
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,480
and so prologue by default does

1390
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,359
backtracking

1391
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,760
using a forward chaining technique which

1392
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,359
i'm going to get into momentarily

1393
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,680
so it starts with a conclusion like uh

1394
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,400
bob likes pizza

1395
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,559
yes or no versus does bob like pizza

1396
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,599
or what sport does bob like

1397
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,079
forward chaining fortune is a lot harder

1398
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,280
to do

1399
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,359
because we don't know it has to exhaust

1400
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,480
more of the database

1401
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,240
if i said what sport does bob like

1402
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,599
we have to go through the entire

1403
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,400
database to see how many times is bob

1404
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,480
in there and what sports does he like in

1405
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,800
there and how are we going to figure out

1406
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,040
which sport bob likes

1407
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,319
versus saying bob likes pin

1408
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,280
uh paintball uh pig balls when he likes

1409
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,800
playing with paintballs or he likes

1410
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,480
baskets let's just say basketball

1411
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,880
he likes playing basketball so we look

1412
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,720
just for basketball and see if bob's

1413
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,800
associated with basketball if he's not

1414
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,920
it's a clear answer no he doesn't so it

1415
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,960
depends on whether you're going to start

1416
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,079
with a conclusion

1417
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:08,960
or you're going to start with a

1418
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,920
hypothesis so like if i say

1419
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,640
you know it's going to rain today or

1420
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,640
it's not going to rain today and if i

1421
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,319
said probably it's not going to rain

1422
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:18,720
today

1423
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,880
it's going to come back and say no

1424
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,280
because it is raining right now actually

1425
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,400
it isn't campbell all right

1426
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,839
i live in campbell by the way

1427
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,960
uh so you know what when you go back to

1428
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,319
when i go back to campus i

1429
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,880
will have to actually commute but the

1430
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,400
roads aren't too bad these days

1431
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,640
so unless it's raining i can ask

1432
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,440
prologue is the commute going to be bad

1433
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,680
that's forward chaining by the way and

1434
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,359
it comes back and says yes

1435
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,319
or no prologue could come back and say

1436
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,599
if i ask for a log i'm going to do

1437
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,559
another example

1438
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,240
forward forward prologue is it gonna be

1439
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:56,640
a

1440
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,520
long commute prologue could come back

1441
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,160
and say

1442
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,800
no because everybody's staying home

1443
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,280
right now

1444
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,400
if i said a backward approach prologue

1445
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
the commute's terrible

1446
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,480
problem can come back and say no it's

1447
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,240
not terrible everyone's staying home

1448
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,640
right now

1449
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,280
so don't get too concerned with it i'm

1450
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,880
not gonna ask you anything like that on

1451
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,680
an exam

1452
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,839
but it's just understanding that there

1453
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,839
are two directions kind of helps you put

1454
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,760
it into perspective

1455
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,880
the prolog database has already

1456
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,040
been configured especially the one

1457
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,200
online and there's no way of changing it

1458
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,440
it's going to do it backward tracking

1459
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,520
uh it's going to do this exactly right

1460
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,640
here from bottom up

1461
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,000
so it starts with each one of the rules

1462
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,839
and then checks for facts

1463
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,839
so using the database systematically

1464
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,680
generating new theorems until one

1465
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,319
matches

1466
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,280
the query that is found so father bob

1467
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,240
mann is

1468
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,520
equal to father given the gold man bob

1469
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,440
under forward chaining father bob is

1470
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,960
matched against father

1471
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,280
x to derive a move back to man bob in

1472
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,960
the database and in fact satisfies the

1473
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,839
goal and so we can come back and say

1474
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,480
yeah

1475
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,400
and bob is a father

1476
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,040
if he's in the database that way

1477
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,480
backwards chaining from a top-up

1478
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,000
perspective starts with the facts

1479
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,280
and uses the rules that apply use the

1480
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,680
goals to work backwards to the fact

1481
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,440
given man bob as the goal you match

1482
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,359
against man x to create a new goal

1483
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,200
father bob father bob the goal matches

1484
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,400
pre-existing fact

1485
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,720
does the query is also satisfied satisfy

1486
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,799
both directions so it doesn't mean that

1487
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,000
forward

1488
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,599
or backward top down versus bottom up

1489
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,200
is going to produce any different

1490
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,960
results for you it's just a different

1491
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,960
systematic approach

1492
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,799
so for example i could ask the question

1493
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,599
you know no unless i get talked about

1494
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,480
rain anymore

1495
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,000
uh is csu east bay going to open back up

1496
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,880
again

1497
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,359
or when is csu east bay going to open

1498
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,720
back up again and i thought we're going

1499
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,040
to

1500
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,280
if i were a prologue i'm not really

1501
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,319
guessing if i had logic in my system

1502
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,440
to figure this out i'd say well alameda

1503
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,400
county

1504
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,839
what tier are they in and if

1505
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,799
in the database it said tier purple and

1506
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,480
then there was a rule in a database that

1507
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,119
said

1508
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,640
in the tier purple no online class no

1509
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,240
face-to-face classes can take place

1510
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,200
then i would recently deduce that no csu

1511
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:29,920
east bay is

1512
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,280
not opened up but if the tear changes to

1513
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,160
tear red

1514
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,720
and i ask the same question the system

1515
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,040
might come back and say yes

1516
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,000
they are because they're interred the

1517
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,119
difference though

1518
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,799
is that prologue doesn't tell you the

1519
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,040
because

1520
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,040
it doesn't tell you that because it will

1521
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,760
just come back and say yes or no

1522
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,359
it's kind of like does bob like

1523
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,599
chocolate well we don't know if bob

1524
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,880
likes chocolate

1525
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,960
but in the database if bob likes cake

1526
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,160
and all cake are chocolate and bob likes

1527
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:04,960
donuts

1528
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,520
and all donuts are chocolate and bob

1529
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,799
likes ice cream and

1530
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,440
all ice cream is chocolate then probably

1531
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,799
would deduce

1532
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,119
that bob likes chocolate because all of

1533
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,319
these other things

1534
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,680
have chocolate in it which is

1535
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,440
kind of like how people figure out what

1536
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,119
they like or they don't like

1537
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,880
if you think about it which is kind of

1538
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,480
funny because people have weird

1539
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,240
food preferences because sometimes i

1540
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,599
like something

1541
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,559
i have uh well my sister actually claims

1542
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,400
she doesn't like eggs

1543
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,640
however she eats a lot of foods that

1544
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,480
have eggs in them

1545
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,920
so i'm thinking how could you say you

1546
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,839
don't like eggs that's logically

1547
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,040
incorrect

1548
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,599
when you're eating like omelettes that

1549
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,280
have eggs

1550
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,280
sorry you know it's like wow it's like

1551
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
saying you don't like cheese but you eat

1552
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,440
pizza with cheese on it how could you

1553
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,640
say you don't like

1554
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,079
cheese so it's prolog

1555
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,480
can't make those mistakes because it

1556
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,920
only knows

1557
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,000
what people like and don't like if you

1558
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,520
put it in as a fact

1559
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,280
i put it in prolog database that's the

1560
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,280
fact that

1561
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,040
this is a prediction system you can

1562
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,559
predict what kind of pizza barb would

1563
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:13,040
like

1564
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,880
because we could say barb likes ham

1565
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,040
barber likes pineapple barb likes cheese

1566
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,920
broth likes red sauce barbecue

1567
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,119
i can't prologue what kind of pizza does

1568
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,240
barb like

1569
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,079
it can come back and tell me you want a

1570
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:27,280
hawaiian pizza

1571
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,760
or you want meat lovers pizza or you

1572
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,200
want

1573
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,359
so which is actually kind of funny

1574
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,440
because some of the pizza companies do

1575
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,160
this

1576
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,200
i tell you well click some boxes here or

1577
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,200
when you sign up for services it says

1578
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,119
you know what kind of music do you what

1579
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,880
stations do you listen to

1580
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,599
what kind of music do you like and then

1581
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,680
it makes some recommendations for you

1582
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,760
that's prologue that's a great example

1583
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,839
of a prologue database wine pizza is

1584
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:54,160
like

1585
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,359
stabbed in the heart for italians yeah

1586
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,400
it is

1587
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,359
it's not really italian yeah i like you

1588
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,880
know you guys are making me hungry now

1589
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,319
because i think i'm gonna actually order

1590
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,000
pizza for lunch

1591
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,760
anyway yeah um barb does like hawaiian

1592
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,440
pizza by the way

1593
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,520
yeah okay forward and backward chaining

1594
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,520
that's what i just described here we

1595
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,520
have bottom-up resolution for

1596
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,880
chaining our top-down resolution

1597
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,480
backward chain and that's the other

1598
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,119
thing

1599
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,119
that's the other thing that prolog can

1600
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,880
also be programmed to look at

1601
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,400
all right we're all different ages

1602
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,160
we're definitely past the age of five

1603
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,240
years old however

1604
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,480
hopefully everybody in the class is over

1605
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,440
five

1606
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,680
and i don't know around five-ish the

1607
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,280
theorists the psychologists say that's

1608
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,200
when we start actually developing our

1609
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,440
true memories of things

1610
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,559
so up until like five or so

1611
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,559
four or five is debatable but there's a

1612
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,400
certain time when you're a baby

1613
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,920
you keep going back and forth i like

1614
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,200
this i don't like this i like this i

1615
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:55,920
don't like this

1616
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,200
and who knows what you like but around

1617
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,200
the age of five you start developing

1618
00:59:59,200 --> 00:59:59,599
some

1619
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,640
strong interests i like writing i like

1620
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,760
listening all right just because you

1621
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,440
liked something when you were five years

1622
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,280
old that's the bottom of the database

1623
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,200
and every year you're six you're seven

1624
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,280
you're 10 you're 15 you're 20.

1625
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,760
each year you keep adding more facts to

1626
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,559
it

1627
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,359
so then people change their mind when i

1628
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,480
was five i didn't really like sushi

1629
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,599
now that i'm older the topper

1630
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,680
the higher levels of the likes when it

1631
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,520
comes to food

1632
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,119
likes sushi like not liking vegetables

1633
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,640
and then liking vegetables

1634
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,079
when it comes to food for kids uh

1635
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,280
so the data changes in the knowledge

1636
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,000
base

1637
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,839
and if our brain is sort of like a

1638
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,760
prologue knowledge base

1639
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,400
then we're constantly changing the facts

1640
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,599
and the rules

1641
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,440
and so what is going to end up happening

1642
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,720
here

1643
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,799
is that we're going to we're going to

1644
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,160
prove ourselves right or

1645
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,079
wrong depending upon which direction in

1646
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,319
the knowledge phase we're searching

1647
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,680
so if i started from the bottom and i

1648
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,240
said

1649
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,559
okay do i like sushi i'm gonna come back

1650
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,680
with no no

1651
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,160
no no way at the top we're going to see

1652
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,799
a yes

1653
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,920
up there so here's ways of

1654
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,200
creating it so that prologue continues

1655
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,119
the search you just put a semicolon into

1656
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:19,680
the

1657
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,160
box it says okay i found a no a no i

1658
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,799
know okay i got a yes i got a yes

1659
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,280
because the facts have changed so it

1660
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,559
depends on whether you're going forward

1661
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,280
versus

1662
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,079
backward in terms of the newest versus

1663
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,200
the oldest facts

1664
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,559
most databases will look at the newest

1665
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,040
now this is the new information that's

1666
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,000
on the top

1667
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,839
not the bottom if you start at the

1668
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,200
bottom you go all the way through the

1669
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,440
entire history of your entire life to

1670
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,040
see if you like something it's going to

1671
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,400
change over time

1672
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,760
if you look at the top you're going to

1673
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,160
get a more accurate answer in this last

1674
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,760
year do i like sushi yes

1675
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,240
then i'm going to get a more definite

1676
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,920
correct answer so a lot of people didn't

1677
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,440
want to go through the entire database

1678
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,559
and you're not going to search through

1679
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,400
the entire database

1680
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,680
you're going to look at the last the

1681
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,359
most recent the most recent entries

1682
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,799
okay so bottom up searches the database

1683
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,319
from facts to rules and attempts to find

1684
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,599
the sequence of matches within the

1685
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,839
database to satisfy the goal top advance

1686
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,440
starts with the goal

1687
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,880
the backward chaining starts with the

1688
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,720
goal the conclusion i call it a

1689
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,440
conclusion

1690
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,000
it's goal and then searches the database

1691
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,440
to see if it can

1692
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,559
be satisfied can we satisfy the goal is

1693
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,799
it going there it's going to rain today

1694
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,359
yes or no versus is it going to rain

1695
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,799
today

1696
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,240
so i'm not going to pick a side here i

1697
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,760
picked the goal already and see if it's

1698
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,480
true

1699
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,160
here i find out what the goal actually

1700
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,480
is so

1701
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,240
the second part of the resolution is the

1702
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,400
depth versus versus the breadth first

1703
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,839
search and this is if you

1704
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,119
have taken data structures and

1705
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,880
algorithms and you know there's two ways

1706
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,400
of searching if you're going to exhaust

1707
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,319
the search tree

1708
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,599
so this is the large search space

1709
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,720
we're going to apply depth or prep so if

1710
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,599
we do dab

1711
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,000
we go all the way down you start at root

1712
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,599
go all the way down

1713
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,240
each one of the chains to the lowest

1714
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,520
depth

1715
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,079
of the tree to see if we can satisfy the

1716
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:14,799
goal

1717
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,079
versus breadth going this way the whole

1718
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:18,880
level one

1719
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,599
the level two the level three process

1720
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,720
all the sub girls

1721
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,680
parallel versus going down and seeing if

1722
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,520
each one of the sub goals can be

1723
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,880
satisfied

1724
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,440
prolog designers went with a top-down

1725
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,640
backward chaining

1726
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,520
depth burst resolution process by

1727
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,039
default

1728
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,920
it does not mean you can't change these

1729
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,880
things

1730
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,920
if you this is an open source utility

1731
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,440
open source

1732
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,039
compiler you can certainly reprogram it

1733
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,400
or change it

1734
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,039
so that it does something differently by

1735
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,000
default we're going to have backward

1736
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,559
chaining

1737
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,760
i'm going to see if the goal is true and

1738
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,280
we're going to go debt first

1739
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,599
because once we have exhausted one path

1740
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,039
if one of the sub goals

1741
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,920
does not exist the whole goal doesn't

1742
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,119
exist

1743
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,359
so if you're trying to find out if bob's

1744
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,039
a father

1745
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,160
but bob is not male we gotta

1746
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,000
we're immediately gonna say no bob's not

1747
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,440
a father

1748
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,640
bob might be a mother if

1749
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,319
we can't satisfy that one goal and we

1750
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,920
can't satisfy be going through a debt

1751
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,760
first we're gonna eliminate half of the

1752
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,799
search space

1753
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,599
constantly but why continue checking if

1754
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,079
one of the facts is already wrong

1755
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,839
so it proves to be a little faster

1756
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,038
in terms of solving the goal

1757
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,839
backward chances for uncle male sibling

1758
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,200
here's a sibling for you

1759
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,000
as a parent it's called backward

1760
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,640
chaining and

1761
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,240
you can go through the process on your

1762
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,000
own it takes a little bit of

1763
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,640
sitting and looking at it okay so i

1764
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,400
already went through the little example

1765
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,640
here

1766
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,359
and we're gonna i'm gonna do the list

1767
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,400
next time

1768
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,520
uh if you wanna look ahead it's pretty

1769
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,880
easy

1770
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,640
you might actually if you if you really

1771
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,079
wanna look ahead on the prologue

1772
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,319
list uh so this is past the first one

1773
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,079
and i highly recommend doing is pretty

1774
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:12,880
easy

1775
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,720
um here actually i'll just show you the

1776
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,400
list real quick here

1777
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,520
and i'll go through more of those

1778
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,640
examples uh prolog lists are not too bad

1779
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,000
they look like this they have these

1780
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,760
square brackets

1781
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,799
so append x and y

1782
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,839
with one two three this is the append

1783
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:30,720
predicate

1784
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,559
they call it a predicate is it really

1785
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,480
the syntax kind of he follows through

1786
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,559
the head and the tail it's a link list

1787
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,240
believe it or not

1788
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,160
so consider the following angle head

1789
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,319
versus tail so we have one two

1790
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,319
three four head is one the tail is two

1791
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,559
three four

1792
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,359
so in developing the list here's a list

1793
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,039
it has a square brackets

1794
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,200
an empty list has nothing inside of it

1795
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,160
so prolog

1796
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,400
list consists of zero or more elements

1797
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,839
separated by commas they can be

1798
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:00,640
characters

1799
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,839
numbers they can be anything uh they

1800
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,039
could actually be a list

1801
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,520
inside of a list just like prologue the

1802
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,319
lists are not

1803
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,920
stuck to just one data type

1804
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
uh here's some examples the head could

1805
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,920
be equal to one the tail can be equal to

1806
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,400
two

1807
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,000
three av so h matches the first element

1808
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,799
in the list

1809
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,400
t matches the rest of the list

1810
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,480
you can ask it t one two three four it's

1811
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,480
gonna come back and say yes because

1812
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,960
the tail is one two three four the head

1813
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,559
is one

1814
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,240
all right the tail excuse me is two

1815
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,720
three four

1816
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,640
think of it as like linked list the

1817
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,400
first element is the head the rest of

1818
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,079
it's the tail

1819
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,280
so here's a pen where we're going to

1820
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,039
take this list and this list and append

1821
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,640
it together to this list

1822
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,839
so x is equal to 1 2 3 a b

1823
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,640
because we have 1 2 3 and a b that's

1824
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,240
going into x

1825
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,280
do not think of these as

1826
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,160
functions because they're not functions

1827
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,119
think of them

1828
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,440
as a list fact

1829
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,720
so 1 2 3 comma a b comma

1830
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,000
x takes x and makes it

1831
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,160
into one two three a b because it's

1832
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,319
appending and the function append

1833
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,039
is actually built in by the way so what

1834
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:21,839
you're going to do

1835
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,599
with those number two through five

1836
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,280
is use built-in functions to achieve the

1837
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,160
goal

1838
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,920
of what it is you're trying to do what

1839
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,599
you're trying to accomplish so

1840
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,400
to take two lists and put them together

1841
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,760
that's really an append

1842
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,359
actually so intent might help you with

1843
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,760
the assignment

1844
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,280
so to append these guys together x

1845
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,559
is 1 2 3

1846
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,920
a b and x is now

1847
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,359
a and b

1848
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,200
so take a look at these go through the

1849
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,440
tutorials that are on the swishy site

1850
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,480
when it comes to lists

1851
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,599
you could google it on the open internet

1852
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:08,480
but

1853
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,799
uh there's some right wrong answers out

1854
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:11,520

1855
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,240

01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,800
from which we don't need to um

1904
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,239

that uh where is it

1906
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,880
let me share it actually

1907
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,040
like for when i went to swish

1908
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,840
you saw the screen

1909
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,199
all right let me enlarge it so i can get

1910
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,839
a better view

1911
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,920
this stuff is in here because i hit the

1912
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,000
run button you can actually close that

1913
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,320
out

1914
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,560
there we go yeah but mine shows an empty

1915
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,719
one and the left side it says like

1916
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,840
program in the right side i

1917
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,560
kind of know how it goes but for the

1918
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,080
left side

1919
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,760
why because um i clicked on

1920
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,600
first steps knowledge bases

1921
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,320
see where is that located uh right to

1922
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,840
the left or says welcome to swish

1923

[Music]

1924
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,679
in the examples

1925
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,600
up in the left hand corner you'll see

1926

1928
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,040
it'll say examples and then if you click

1929
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,199
on knowledge base

1930
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,199
it shows you this knowledge-based stuff

1931
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,760
you can actually do this you can take

1932
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,840
this oh i see it and copy it

1933
