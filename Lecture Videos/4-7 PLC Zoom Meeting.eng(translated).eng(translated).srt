phone with me

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
all right so um i guess this is an

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
interesting experiment

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
uh yeah i need dual authentication on

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
your phone

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
uh thank you roberto yes i do have it

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
however

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
i don't have my phone with me i'm

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
teaching a class why would i bring my

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,840
phone with me and why would students be

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
on their phone

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,840
during a class meeting so

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
concept's kind of weird uh so we're not

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,519
going to be able to get into blackboard

59
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,239
right now

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
um actually

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
uh you know what i'm going to try

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
something else though real quick here

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,599
just to see if this works i think there

64
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,360
i have a way of bypassing this

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
nope i don't so now my phone with me so

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
i can't send myself a push notification

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
and for some strange reason it won't

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
send me a text message either i have to

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,560
go through the duo app

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,840
so wow technology gone astray

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,280
technology uh working against us that's

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,159
what this is

73
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,040
um not a fan of the do authentication so

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,680
far

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,440
um anyway uh i can still move on from

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,239
this

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,080
uh let's see and if you haven't signed

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
up for the duo authentication you might

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,760
want to soon because you're going to

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
have the same problem i have

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
uh you need well actually i've signed up

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,280
for it um

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
so you're going to need to sign up for

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
it get the app put it on your phone and

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,879
then use it to log in

86
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,440
quite quite the hassle okay

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,959
okay so let's see um assignment number

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,560
five is not due for a while

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
it's all the information that you need

90
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,840
excuse me

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
for the assignments and for the schedule

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
are going to be in blackboard

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,799
i'm going to share my screen and i want

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,319
to talk about assignment number six for

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,439
you right now

96
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,799
um so assignment number six

97
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
you definitely want to read chapter five

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,319
before attempting to complete assignment

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,959
number six there's also a lovely lecture

100
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,840
in the course materials called chapters

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,640
uh

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
chapter five but there's also one called

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
chapter six seven and eight

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
that's kind of a short version of it uh

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,720
but for the final exam you are gonna

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,120
want

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,759
to read chapters five six seven and

108
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
eight

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
so four chapters so after the spring

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,759
break

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,320
what you're working on now if you're up

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
to date

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,759
is assignments five six and seven that

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,360
require chapters five six

115
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
seven and eight no chapter nine

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,120
uh we'll stop at eight and these are the

117
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
same chapters regardless of any version

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
whichever version of the textbook that

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
you might have

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
okay so you want to read chapter 5 on

121
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
names bindings type checking in scope

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
and you're going to answer these five

123
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,639
questions

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,960
in the course materials there's a really

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,479
good video

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,400
the video is going to show you um

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
how to answer these questions and i talk

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
about each one of these questions but i

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,039
wanted to go over it live

130
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,919
just to see if we had any questions from

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,800
you guys

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,639
about what you're going to do but also

133
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
to add just you know

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
a little intro to this these types of

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
questions

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
were final exam questions or similar to

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,960
the type of final exam

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
questions that we had in the

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
face-to-face class

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
and they were basically to test your

141
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,199
understanding of the chapter readings

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,120
so and i'll go over how to answer these

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,960
questions in a moment here

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
uh but i just kind of want to tell you

145
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,280
that your final exam is not going to be

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,880
in this format you're going to have a

147
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,600
multiple

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
choice true false exam that is run

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,199
through blackboard using the respondus

150
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,000
browser

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,960
just like the midterm so your final exam

152
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
will be very similar to the format of

153
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,280
the midterm exam

154
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,240
probably it's the worth 35 points

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
instead of 30 points so probably there's

156
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,919
going to be one or two additional

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,880
questions

158
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
but for the most part um it should look

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
a very it should be a very similar

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,319
experience for you and if you had any

161
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,759
problems with the midterm

162
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,520
if you send me an email message and let

163
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
me know what those were

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
i can improve things for the future and

165
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
maybe i can change whatever the

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
problem may have been for the midterm

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,680
for the final as well

168
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
um most students didn't have any

169
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,840
problems taking the midterm a couple of

170
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
students had the browser

171
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,720
time out on them or had weak internet

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,360
access

173
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,919
and they contacted me and we had it

174
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,720
reset

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
um so if you do have a problem while

176
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,039
taking it i know it's kind of early

177
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,639
right now to be thinking about the final

178
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
but we are on the home stretch

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
um so just keep in mind although it will

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
be online you will also have a one week

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
to take it in the students who ended up

182
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,160
with the most

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
problems ended up contacting me like the

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
night before or the day before it was

185
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,759
actually due

186
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,319
so you know they procrastinated and when

187
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,319
you procrastinate inevitably technology

188
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,080
doesn't work in your favor

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
so anyway so i'm going to go over this

190
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
assignment real quick here

191
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
and then uh i thought i had the chat

192
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,680
open

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,360
hold on one second can't see the chat

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,880
technology challenge today uh it's okay

195
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,479
uh i'll wait until the end and i'll

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
close the share and open up the chat to

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
see if there's any questions

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
all right so what are you gonna do here

199
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,280
you google these questions you're gonna

200
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,840
get a lot of bad answers on the internet

201
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,960
because a lot of students have not

202
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,160
figured out how to answer these

203
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
questions appropriately and there

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,720
is no real real true answers to any of

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,080
these questions

206
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,680
they're all open-ended questions for

207
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
example let me just read the first one

208
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
too and talk about that one

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
some programming languages are typeless

210
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,080
okay

211
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,759
what are the obvious advantages and

212
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
disadvantages of having no types in a

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
language

214
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
all right depending upon your

215
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
perspective and your background you can

216
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,280
answer this in about

217
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,680
maybe 20 different ways 15 to 20

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,199
different ways

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,280
and the one that way that i like to

220
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,960
answer and it doesn't necessarily

221
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
need to be the way that you like to

222
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
answer it

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,360
is something along the lines of

224
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
if a language is languages that are

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,199
typeless

226
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,400
from an advantage point of view

227
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
um only the memory needed to store

228
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
a variable for example instead of

229
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
putting a type on a variable

230
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
instead the compiler can figure out

231
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,720
exactly how much

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
memory is needed

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,399
to be required to save that variable in

234
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,519
memory

235
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,159
and not over allocate or under allocate

236
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
and it can also the compiler can also be

237
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,039
smart about

238
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,800
picking the right size but also the

239
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,920
right types of

240
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,080
operations that might be good for that

241
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,480
particular variable

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
you know it's like the age-old example

243
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,839
of where a student

244
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,040
would create a float f and then just put

245
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
an integer value in there

246
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
or a double or a string and put a

247
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
character value in there

248
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,320
so if you created a string and used a

249
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
string type

250
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
and you just put a character in there

251
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,839
the compiler would reserve enough memory

252
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
for the size of a string and not for a

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
character and so we would over allocate

254
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
that particular piece of memory

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
um now the disadvantages and i'm giving

256
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,519
you example about how you can answer

257
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
this question

258
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
a disadvantage of having no types

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
might be the fact that you can't do any

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,160
type checking

261
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
so at compile time before the program

262
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,519
actually runs

263
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,560
and you can't tell if the types are

264
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,279
correct

265
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
or if we're going to have enough memory

266
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,480
and if we

267
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,839
don't have enough memory what's going to

268
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,800
happen

269
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
so i mean is is it gonna allocate the

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,480
memory reallocate it

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,560
what's gonna happen we don't know about

272
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
that because we haven't determined ahead

273
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,839
of time what these types are

274
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,600
we're just gonna use it so there might

275
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
be a higher potential for runtime errors

276
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,320
so disadvantage maybe some higher

277
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
runtime errors because

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,040
the reasons i just mentioned advantages

279
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
may be conservative

280
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,680
it might actually be a more conservative

281
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
and

282
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,519
you know not a wasteful memory

283
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,880
allocation

284
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,240
okay that would be an appropriate way

285
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
to answer number one let me give you an

286
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,959
inappropriate way

287
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200
so you know you're not doing this right

288
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
okay

289
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
don't go through it's hard it's easy

290
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,839
it's difficult

291
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,040
it's efficient it's user friendly it's

292
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
not user friendly

293
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
if what you're answering for the

294
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,680
question can be

295
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
used in multiple questions the answer's

296
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680
wrong

297
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
for example if i say what are some of

298
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
the obvious advantages and disadvantages

299
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
of having note types

300
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,519
in a language i said the advantage it's

301
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
easier for the programmer

302
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,480
well that doesn't say enough because you

303
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
i can say it's easier for the programmer

304
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,440
for number three it's easier for the

305
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
programmer for number four

306
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
um say why if you're gonna say it's

307
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,279
easier it's just

308
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,360
say that well the programmer doesn't

309
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,480
have to type

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
in the actual type they don't have to

311
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,160
actually put that in the code so there's

312
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
fewer lines of code

313
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
that need to be written so it's an

314
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
easier task for the programmer who

315
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,760
doesn't actually have to decide

316
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,440
what they're gonna how much memory

317
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
they're gonna need to reserve for this

318
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
particular type and if you look at the

319
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,200
concept

320
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,320
of types the

321
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
uh the type allocates the amount of

322
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,680
resources that are going to be used for

323
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,480
it

324
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,440
so um

325
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
and a disadvantage of having no types in

326
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,720
a language a bad answer would be it

327
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
causes problems

328
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
or it causes it could cause a runtime

329
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,079
error

330
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
so if you're gonna say causes problems

331
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,360
or it could cause an error

332
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,880
or it could cause a run timer say why

333
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,279
so you know just give a little bit more

334
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,240
information

335
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,920
if you turn it in and i don't like your

336
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
answers i'll turn it back to you

337
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
and say well okay uh you know can you

338
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
add a little bit more information to

339
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,320
this

340
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,839
it's not right and again

341
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,839
you know it's try to add enough

342
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,040
information to answer the question

343
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
but you don't have to write a novel here

344
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,399
either

345
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,240
so paragraph one or two paragraphs if

346
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
you're going over two paragraphs

347
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,200
you're probably writing too much um and

348
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,079
a paragraph

349
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,880
is three to five sentences so if you're

350
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,760
writing more than

351
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
ten sentences to answer any of these

352
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,519
questions

353
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
you're putting in way too much

354
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
information and be direct

355
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
and answer the question i don't need the

356
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
background information

357
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
i'm going to assume you know what

358
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
typelist means

359
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
i'm going to assume you know what typed

360
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,360
languages are or what types are

361
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
you don't have to start you know in the

362
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,200
beginning of time we had typed

363
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,279
and we had non-typed programming

364
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,399
languages and the

365
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,920
programming languages they used types

366
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
are blah blah blah and the ones that

367
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
donor blah blah

368
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,880
that's just way too much information and

369
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
so be direct

370
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,639
now you'll get answers to all of these

371
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,600
questions

372
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,240
in the lecture videos that i have posted

373
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,079
on youtube that are available in the

374
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,040
class

375
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,160
that are in the blackboard

376
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,800
section in the course materials section

377
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
that i was going to show you to until

378
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
that dual

379
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
authenticator blocked me because i don't

380
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,880
have my cell phone with me

381
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,240
so anyway you know what i think when i

382
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
get done with this i'm gonna try it

383
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
again and see if i can get it by email

384
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
but i don't think that's gonna happen

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,920
but anyway um so

386
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
i'm gonna stop this share for a moment

387
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
and find out if we have any questions

388
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:03,519
about assignment number six

389
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,360
anybody have any questions about it

390
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
anything in there that doesn't make any

391
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,240
sense to you

392
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
if you uh run into a question you can

393
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,959
always send me an email message

394
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,399
you can also send me the assignment and

395
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
say am i writing enough is this enough

396
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,000
information and i can tell you yes or no

397
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,279
well you're thinking about that i'm

398
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
going to switch the share over and talk

399
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,320
about assignment number seven which is

400
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
very similar so assignment number

401
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,800
six is on chapter five and

402
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,000
the questions are you know

403
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
uh they're worded in a particular way in

404
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,720
fact actually most of the questions come

405
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,639
or variations of the questions at the

406
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
end of the chapters

407
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
and so if you're a smart student

408
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,920
and you want to make sure that you

409
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,040
understand this the

410
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,880
information that's in the chapters and i

411
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
highly recommend reading chapters 5

412
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,760
6 seven and eight um

413
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,079
then what i would do is see if you can

414
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,480
answer some of the questions

415
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,199
in the back of the chapters that are

416
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,360
these are variations of those questions

417
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
and again in number seven you have one

418
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,120
two three four

419
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
five you have five

420
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
you have five questions worth five

421
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
points one point for each question

422
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,079
and the same rules apply you wanna

423
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,199
answer it

424
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,199
and i wanna basically talk about number

425
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
four and number five in this particular

426
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,760
case

427
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,839
um and i'm gonna give you the answers to

428
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,440
number four number five because what

429
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
ends up happening is i get people that

430
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,399
google this stuff

431
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
and then they get really bad answers

432
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
from the internet

433
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
because number four number five are

434
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,880
trick questions uh so

435
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
and but you want to read chapter six

436
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
this is on again

437
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
on the data type so seven and eight are

438
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,600
really easy

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,279
chapters um so if you're running low on

440
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,920
time read chapter five read chapter six

441
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
you could browse through seven and eight

442
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,399
or watch the videos that i put on seven

443
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:00,880
and eight

444
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,519
i have a two part series that goes over

445
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,199
six seven and eight

446
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
and i have a series that goes over five

447
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,360
that's in the course materials

448
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
let's take a look then at question

449
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,399
number four

450
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
this is what significant justification

451
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,759
is there

452
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,320
for the and then this is the line with

453
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,800
the

454
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
arrow next to it operator in crc plus

455
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
plus

456
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
so if you're familiar with c or c plus

457
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,160
plus

458
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,519
we know that pointers use a dot excuse

459
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:29,920
me

460
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,480
pointers use a an asterisk symbol

461
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,040
there's a

462
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,120
reference and there's a d reference and

463
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,680
we use a dot notation

464
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,680
with regular value based variables and

465
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,800
types

466
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
for example if i said you know

467
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,040
a new new peep peep dot

468
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,720
get name pete dot set name but when we

469
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,920
use

470
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,120
like for example a structure and we go

471
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,839
you know let's say that peep you know a

472
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,839
little peeps if we just had easter

473
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,160
the little chocolate pepper marshmallow

474
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,319
keeps with the sugar on top of them

475
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
you're gonna write your teeth out but

476
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,359
they're good

477
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,000
but anyway if you had a peep peeps go on

478
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,039
the internet look at them they're

479
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,559
probably on half price at this point

480
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,799
and we wanted to give the pipa first

481
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,559
name and a last name we could go

482
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,720
peep dot first name is equal to barb

483
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
dot last name is equal to blah blah blah

484
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,840
and if we created a pointer

485
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,080
for this particular structure instance

486
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
we would use the

487
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
line and the arrow operator so just so

488
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,919
you know what that means

489
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,440
that's not the answer to the question

490
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
the question asks we know what

491
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
significant justification

492
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,440
is there well the interesting thing

493
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
is that the correct answer to this

494
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
question

495
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,240
is that there is no significant

496
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
justification

497
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,160
it's senseless and no other language

498
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,360
does it

499
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,799
and if you've looked at java java uses a

500
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,600
dot

501
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
and everything's a pointer if you look

502
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
at c plus plus

503
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
you can sometimes get away depending

504
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,559
upon the compiler and the

505
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,480
compiler checks that are happening by

506
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
just using the dot and not the arrow

507
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
so in the beginning of the development

508
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,160
of the c language

509
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
they felt that the pointer needed a

510
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,400
different scope

511
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,679
resolution or it needed a different

512
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
dot you know because it's a pointer you

513
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280
know we

514
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,559
need it but the thing is is it when you

515
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
when c plus plus came around they pulled

516
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,760
it out

517
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
and you can use with c plus plus objects

518
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,720
you can say you know new peep

519
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
you know my peep is equal to a new peep

520
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,919
and then go p

521
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,640
dot p dot i mean everybody uses a dot

522
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,280
right

523
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,320
and that's all referenced memory so we

524
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
have reference to memory in c

525
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,039
plus plus that uses a dot but you can

526
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,880
also use the arrow if you wanted to

527
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
there's no justification for it

528
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,240
and most languages pulled it out

529
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
removed it completely from the language

530
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,520
then nobody uses this

531
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,880
operator anymore everyone uses a dot

532
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,039
because a dot is a dot right and all

533
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,480
you're doing is referencing

534
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
something inside of something like a

535
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,760
variable

536
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880
a field or a method inside of an object

537
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
you just use the dot the dot does the

538
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
same thing as the arrow

539
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,919
that is the correct answer however i

540
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,799
guarantee it

541
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,039
30 to 40 percent of the class will

542
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,480
google that question

543
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
i'm not gonna google it right now but uh

544
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,679
maybe

545
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
the correct answer is out there now i

546
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,799
don't know

547
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,120
um i have no idea what those other ones

548
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,400
are saying really because they make

549
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
absolutely no sense to me

550
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,280
so so that's it

551
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
and you can just write for number four

552
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
there is no justification there is

553
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,000
absolutely no

554
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
reason to use this operator instead of

555
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,200
the dot

556
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,280
it doesn't do anything different they

557
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
put it in the syntax but they

558
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
never added it to the semantics

559
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
it's just a useless piece of syntax that

560
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
shouldn't exist in the language

561
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,919
all right number five number five says

562
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,440
what are

563
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
oh okay now now be be wary when it says

564
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,320
what are

565
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,960
all of the differences and usually what

566
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
ends up happening is i'll have a student

567
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
send me an email

568
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,320
how many differences should we use if we

569
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
do all how many

570
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
are there in all of the differences

571
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
between the enumeration types of c

572
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
plus plus and those of java like

573
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,080
what are all of them how many of them

574
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
are there for all of them

575
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,120
well again the answer is zero

576
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,159
zero there's no difference okay so

577
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,520
here's what happened

578
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,039
uh c c plus c had the enumeration

579
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,159
i'm going to assume you guys know what

580
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,559
enumeration type is look at the lecture

581
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
read the chapter chapter six you'll

582
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
learn what enumeration is if you don't

583
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,200
know that

584
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
enumerations were a very old way

585
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,559
of putting a symbolic constant to an

586
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,159
integer value

587
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
so instead of saying uh 0 1

588
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,039
2 for our our enumeration options we

589
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,600
could say red white and blue

590
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,440
and so when we in our program say color

591
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,360
is equal to blue

592
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,480
and that would be one our color is equal

593
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,039
to

594
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,280
red now it would be zero if i go red

595
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
white blue

596
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
so who's gonna remember zero who's gonna

597
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,080
remember one

598
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,000
or two what color it was number 59 what

599
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,720
color is that i don't know

600
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
you put a symbolic constant on it like a

601
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,000
color

602
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,200
cyan number 59 is cyan or it's purple

603
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,480
um you put the name on it so you don't

604
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
have to remember a number

605
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
it's kind of like how we all have an an

606
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
enumeration and everybody has the same

607
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
enumeration

608
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,840
in real life we haven't and all of us

609
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,120
humans carry around it

610
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
well in the united states they carry

611
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,880
around an enumeration

612
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
and it's translated into other languages

613
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,320
it's called the 12 months of the year

614
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
january february march april may et

615
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,559
cetera and so forth

616
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,000
well isn't that january is two is

617
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
february

618
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,760
three is march and how many people still

619
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,280
to this day have to come back and say

620
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,600
well

621
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,240
let's see uh february oh and april say

622
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,679
january february march april 4

623
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,320
that's an enumeration is a an

624
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,760
enumeration type

625
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,000
the months names with the month numbers

626
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,480
are enumeration so some people i think

627
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
the numerations came out originally to

628
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,400
help

629
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,080
humans remember how to write the number

630
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,240
and how to write like you know 4-16

631
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,360
dash whatever i think today is for

632
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,120
today's april so today's 4-7

633
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,760
uh but maybe people remember april maybe

634
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,159
they remember four so we have a date

635
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,760
that has a number then we have an

636
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,919
enumeration that has a

637
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
name and then the enumeration is the

638
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
name constant

639
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,559
okay many other examples of enumerations

640
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,760
out there

641
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,039
c started with it c plus plus carried it

642
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,400
over

643
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,720
when java was developed

644
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
java didn't have it they went what do we

645
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,440
need these enumerations for can people

646
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
remember the days of the week

647
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,520
monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday

648
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,039
another enumeration

649
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,400
can't they remember the months of the

650
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
year so if you walk away from anything

651
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
today you know where enumeration is now

652
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
you can you know use it at your next

653
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,000
party whatever you

654
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,280
got how many enumerations do you know

655
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,799
and people are like i have no idea what

656
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
you're talking about

657
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,080
so anyway trivial fact

658
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,039
uh so the enumeration types were not

659
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,080
implemented in java

660
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
because people thought you know isn't

661
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,279
that something from the past people

662
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,159
can't remember

663
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,360
stuff and so

664
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,000
actually i don't know around java 5

665
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
they got tired of listening to all the

666
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
complaints so they put the c

667
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,559
plus plus enumeration back into java

668
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,279
and believe it or not it's identical

669
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,400
it's identical

670
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,960
they just took the c plus feature added

671
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
it to the java language and said here

672
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,120
you go

673
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
we have enumerations now quit

674
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
complaining about it you can use it

675
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,799
but when they queried up there's a whole

676
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
there were a couple of articles on it a

677
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,919
couple years back when they

678
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,679
queried up how many people are actually

679
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,440
using the enumerations they found out

680
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,840
that

681
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,159
nobody in fact most of the people that

682
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,440
were complaining about it have

683
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
absolutely no need for it

684
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,360
enamor issues with you know the aid in

685
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,159
the programming of procedural languages

686
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,600
or for like c is an imperative style

687
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,720
programming language

688
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,520
an enumeration might help you with that

689
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,440
but in an object-oriented world we can

690
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,840
just

691
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,720
put a name we can just create an object

692
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
that has red white and blue in it

693
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
and just use those colors we don't

694
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,559
necessarily have to use a numbering

695
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,799
system like in the old days

696
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,200
so we don't really need it but it's

697
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
still there

698
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,559
and it was added to java and it's the

699
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,159
same feature that is

700
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,919
implemented in c plus plus and if you

701
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,200
haven't noticed

702
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,400
java syntax is almost identical to c

703
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,400
plus plus or c you know integer i looks

704
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,799
the same in all three languages

705
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,600
and c is different from c plus plus but

706
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
java kind of is patterned after

707
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,240
both of those two languages but in any

708
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,840
case the answer to number five the

709
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,360
correct answer

710
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
what are all of the differences is that

711
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,360
there are no differences

712
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,159
it's the same construct used for the

713
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,200
same way but now you know what

714
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
enumeration is

715
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
so usually the purpose of this is for

716
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,919
you to look up

717
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,159
and understand what an enumeration type

718
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,679
is and then once you know what an

719
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,520
enumeration type is then you can go

720
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,120
why do we have it what are the

721
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,720
differences between these two languages

722
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,679
and

723
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,720
really there's only one way

724
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,000
to implement an enumeration

725
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
now enumerations are kind of limited in

726
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,520
that one way

727
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
so if you're going to put a named

728
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,679
constant on a number

729
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,159
you can't reuse the names because if i

730
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,159
have a numeration number one and it has

731
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,840
red white and blue in it and i created

732
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,159
an

733
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,440
enumeration number two and i put red

734
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,200
white and green in it i have two broken

735
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,799
numerations because do i know is red

736
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,039
this red from this enumeration or is it

737
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,000
the numeration

738
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,720
from red from that enumeration i don't

739
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,000
know

740
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
so most languages don't allow you to

741
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,120
rename

742
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,039
to use the same name in more than one

743
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,480
enumeration

744
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,080
so they're single enumerations but

745
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,400
anyway um that's everything you wanted

746
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,159
to know about the enumeration

747
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,320
and a significant justification none

748
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
so going back to number four i think

749
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
they meant to

750
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,760
implement something in the future to

751
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,039
treat

752
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,919
those i don't know those pointers

753
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,320
different from the regular

754
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
if you haven't noticed actually when it

755
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,360
comes back to number four

756
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,840
if we compare that to java the only

757
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
thing different in the syntax between c

758
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
plus pulse and java for using objects is

759
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,039
the absence of the asterisks

760
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,279
we don't need the asterisks in java you

761
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,880
have to put the asterisk in for the

762
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,760
reference and the d

763
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,240
reference and c plus plus but you don't

764
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,000
have to use it for java

765
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,960
so if you know c plus plus java is an

766
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
easier implementation of the same

767
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,080
language

768
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,919
it runs a little bit differently

769
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,279
trivializing it

770
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,080
but it's practically the same syntax

771
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
it's just an easier version of the same

772
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,880
syntax

773
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,039
with a lot of the kinks worked out so

774
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,559
i'm going to have you answer number one

775
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,240
and number two note that for

776
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
question number two and i also say this

777
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,760
in the video as well

778
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,679
look at this up and see what it is but

779
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,360
you're not going to be tested on that on

780
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,480
the final exam

781
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,960
i don't get into this tombstone versus

782
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,640
lock and key methods for avoiding

783
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,399
dangling pointers

784
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,919
and i don't look at the safety and

785
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,600
implementation costs of

786
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,159
any pointer stuff because pointers are a

787
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,320
thing of the past

788
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,520
nice to know about the pointer used in c

789
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,520
used in device drivers used in

790
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,799
operating systems development but most

791
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,640
of your modern day programming languages

792
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,840
including python doesn't use a pointer

793
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,320
and so it doesn't make very much sense

794
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,360
for you to memorize

795
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,399
pointer specific locking and i don't

796
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,039
know

797
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,240
mechanisms uh only because and you can

798
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,679
just skim through that area in the

799
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,559
chapter as well

800
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,399
because you'll probably never use it in

801
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,000
implementation

802
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,440
so all right and uh

803
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,919
see the videos when it comes to the

804
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,120
information on the rest of i

805
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,919
practically have given most of the the

806
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,120
assignment away

807
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
so this is assignment number six and

808
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,159
number seven that i'm going over today

809
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
any questions on number seven

810
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,159
so those are meant to be fairly

811
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,520
lightweight in fact five

812
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,760
six and seven are very lightweight

813
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
assignments for this class

814
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,120
they you should not find them to be

815
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,799
difficult um

816
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,720
i think probably number four was most

817
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,919
difficult prologue

818
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,159
uh or scheme because people just aren't

819
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,960
familiar with those languages

820
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,399
but we are coming around the home

821
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,880
stretch here we will be ending in about

822
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,399
a month or so

823
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,880
um so you don't want to you don't want

824
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,760
to lag too far

825
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,960
behind you can pop these guys out submit

826
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,039
them and then catch up on any remaining

827
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,480
or missing assignments you might have

828
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,360
you can turn them in

829
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
out of order i do have a lot of students

830
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,039
who maybe have missed number two or

831
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,080
number three

832
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,320
before number five is pretty easy

833
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,039
if you know about the alternative uh and

834
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,279
number six and number seven

835
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,480
are pretty easy uh but the idea right

836
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,919
now is i want you to catch up on the

837
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,120
reading

838
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,399
so please read chapters five six seven

839
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,120
and eight

840
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
before the end of the course before the

841
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
final and i will also have a review

842
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,000
session

843
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,480
um probably about a week or week and a

844
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,600
half

845
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,720
two weeks maybe before the final um i

846
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,000

yeah no no problem um yeah i don't know

918
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,679
why they uh

919
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
you know i just did this i checked in

920
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
you know in the morning before i left to

921
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,760
go to the campus i'm on campus right now

922
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
yeah and then this is the first time

923
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
i've seen it maybe they just implement

924
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,760
it today

925
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,399
it they did yesterday i uh i logged in

926
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,039
to

927
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,640
take a uh a quiz

928
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,799
so it was it was overnight that they

929
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,080
implemented it

930
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,120
wow yeah well it kind of sucks if you

931
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,799
don't carry a phone with me

932
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,760
yeah i guess they expect you to always

933
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
have your phone or

934
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,960
at least log in like when you do have it

935
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,399
and then check the uh

936
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,799
uh remember for the 12 hours or so the

937
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,600
weird thing is

938
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
is like you know do you want like

939
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,600
students in the classroom

940
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,919
on their phones i don't know i guess

941
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,240
maybe they don't expect you to use

942
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,079
canvas or our blackboard on in class

943
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,440
i don't know yeah who knows but anyway

944
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,079
thanks for that heads up

945
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,399
i'll figure something out with that and

946
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,918
i just looked i just look and they don't

947
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,159
use

948
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,520
email you have to use the app yeah they

949
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,280
do yeah you have to use it they

950
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,879
you have to download the app and then it

951
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,040
sends a push notification to your phone

952
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,960
yeah yeah i'm thinking maybe i can get

954
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,359
